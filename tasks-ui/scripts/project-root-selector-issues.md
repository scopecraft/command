# Project Root Selector Testing Issues

## Testing Environment
- Server running on port 9999
- Test date: May 20, 2025

## Issues Found

### 1. Route Navigation Issues
- **Description**: When selecting a different project root, the URL updates correctly with the new root ID parameter, but sometimes the content doesn't refresh immediately.
- **Expected**: Content should immediately reflect the new project root context.
- **Actual**: Sometimes requires a manual page refresh to show content from the new root.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Steps to reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to the home page
  2. Select a different project root from the dropdown
  3. Observe that the URL changes but content may still show from previous root

### 2. Loading State Visibility
- **Description**: The loading spinner sometimes flashes too quickly to be noticed during root switching.
- **Expected**: Loading state should be visible long enough to indicate a change is occurring.
- **Actual**: Loading spinner appears and disappears too quickly for good UX feedback.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Steps to reproduce**: Switch between project roots rapidly and observe the loading indicator behavior.

### 3. Error State Handling
- **Description**: When attempting to select an invalid or unavailable project root, the error state doesn't provide enough information.
- **Expected**: Error message should be descriptive and provide guidance.
- **Actual**: Generic "Error" message displayed without additional context.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Steps to reproduce**: Modify the code to attempt selecting a non-existent project root.

### 4. Root Names Truncation
- **Description**: Root names that are too long are truncated without a tooltip to show the full name.
- **Expected**: Long names should have a tooltip showing the full name on hover.
- **Actual**: Names are truncated with ellipsis but no tooltip is provided.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Steps to reproduce**: Create a project root with a very long name and observe how it's displayed.

### 5. Current Root Indication
- **Description**: The visual indication of the currently selected root in the dropdown menu is subtle and might be missed.
- **Expected**: Current root should be clearly highlighted in the dropdown.
- **Actual**: Current root only has a slight background color change.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Steps to reproduce**: Open the dropdown and look for the currently selected root.

### 6. Keyboard Navigation
- **Description**: Keyboard navigation for the dropdown menu is not fully implemented.
- **Expected**: Users should be able to navigate the dropdown using keyboard (arrow keys, enter, escape).
- **Actual**: Some keyboard controls are missing or not working consistently.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Steps to reproduce**: Try navigating the dropdown using only keyboard.

### 7. State Persistence Across Tabs
- **Description**: When opening a new tab, it doesn't always respect the project root selected in another tab.
- **Expected**: Project root selection should be consistent across tabs via localStorage.
- **Actual**: New tabs sometimes default to the initial root instead of the last selected.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Steps to reproduce**: Select a different project root in one tab, then open a new tab with the application.

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness
- **Description**: On mobile viewport sizes, the dropdown positioning sometimes causes it to be partially off-screen.
- **Expected**: Dropdown should be fully visible regardless of viewport size.
- **Actual**: Dropdown can overflow off-screen on small viewports.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Steps to reproduce**: Test on a mobile device or with browser viewport set to mobile dimensions.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add Transition Effects**: Implement a smooth transition effect when switching between project roots to provide better visual feedback.

2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Provide more descriptive error messages and guidance when errors occur.

3. **Add Tooltips**: Implement tooltips for truncated project root names.

4. **Improve Current Selection Highlight**: Make the currently selected root more visually distinct in the dropdown menu.

5. **Complete Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure full keyboard accessibility for the dropdown component.

6. **Fix State Persistence**: Ensure consistent project root selection across tabs.

7. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve positioning and responsiveness for mobile devices.

8. **Add Confirmation Dialog**: For certain root switches that might lose unsaved work, add a confirmation dialog.

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize issues based on severity and impact on user experience
2. Address high and medium severity issues first
3. Consider these findings for the next UI component implementation
