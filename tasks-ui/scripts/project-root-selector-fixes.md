# Project Root Context Switcher Fixes

## Issue Summary

When navigating to a URL like `http://localhost:9999/e2e/tasks`, the UI still showed tasks from the default project instead of the 'e2e' project, despite the rootId parameter being correctly extracted from the URL.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code, we found:

1. The TaskContext and AreaContext providers were correctly handling rootId from URL and passing it to API calls.

2. The FeatureContext had the rootId implementation but contained a duplicate line with `const { rootId } = useProjectRoot();` which was causing a React warning.

3. The PhaseContext was missing the rootId implementation entirely, which likely caused phases from the wrong project to be loaded.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed FeatureContext**: Removed the duplicate rootId declaration.

2. **Updated PhaseContext**: 
   - Added import for useProjectRoot hook
   - Added rootId to component state
   - Updated fetchPhases and savePhase calls to include rootId
   - Added rootId to useEffect dependency array to re-fetch phases when rootId changes

## Expected Results

With these fixes, navigating to URLs like `http://localhost:9999/e2e/tasks` should now correctly:

1. Show the tasks for the 'e2e' project
2. Load phases from the 'e2e' project
3. Maintain correct context when switching between project roots

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9999/` to view the default project tasks
2. Use the ProjectRootSelector to switch to the 'e2e' project
3. Verify that the URL changes to `http://localhost:9999/e2e/tasks`
4. Verify that the task list updates to show tasks from the e2e project
5. Directly navigate to `http://localhost:9999/e2e/tasks` in a new tab
6. Verify that the task list immediately shows tasks from the e2e project
7. Test similar navigation with phases, features, and areas

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Performance**: Re-fetching data on every rootId change might cause more API calls than necessary. Consider using a more sophisticated caching strategy in the future.

2. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling when switching roots could help users better understand any issues that arise.

3. **UI Feedback**: Adding more visible loading states during root switching would improve user experience.

4. **URL Handling**: Consider adding more robust URL parameter handling to better synchronize state across tabs and page reloads.
