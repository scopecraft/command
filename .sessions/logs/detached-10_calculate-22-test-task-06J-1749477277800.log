I can see results: 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096.\n\n3. **Task Instructions:**\n   - Calculate 2+2\n   - Push result to Log section\n   - If there's already a result in the Log, multiply that result by 4 instead\n\n4. **Mode Selection:**\n   Since this is type:\"test\" and the instruction is clear implementation steps, this should be **Implementation Mode**.\n\n5. **Current Status:**\n   The task status is \"done\" and there are already multiple results in the log. The most recent result appears to be 4096. According to the conditional logic, I should multiply the latest result by 4.\n\nLet me continue with the execution following the task's conditional logic.","signature":"ErMJCkYIBBgCKkCSK8hkMjbNUKB0EmjxyTO2wXla3+kTmOv8C66Q+7nECUT88QNO8J8fcys9OQgSoK4qZncQHIjfwZWcmzUomwRdEgyvaNq9swpIsCz3OL0aDGkzx/ZHe1XqfUzIlyIwHFc+ILqDClqhRg+HDroMOrSBIaCOvil2scFOF+DT1zVBzDiX7MqxGatptrjLCrxVKpoILn50ll4OMkIyyCM5D+ugi0oYnhQ7t3Q6fuRyqYN4CqTgFqjmIPoJDEq0+MBQ4GJMiZ+DoJx7CAw6y1MswT8sSy+yxfBaksq1wzwhgrgEMfw2nWqxYfOeQkAthE9b7K26FJGir5ZPikUvA5bBoY7+vHeXE6CXgd52foEqnTByiNsdPK71/NdZmViHC1trvZjzMLbUESsq9Izau/nxMB4WXqKl/ovSM4umF9v6ltLzEvqjFoXFU2Gi827+FNJ1flefL/F1qs5EITFzKP72G60bkINfEz2ylVf1O8NOR7CZk6+j6jHJranw2NrzuE4X2AdmyEnJ+1m9mIO5paqW7ruPj+AbD9CktOJJ1v/JJcRwPg8LFUy8khRlSQgmbDdkvw/jEl4bDgyg/qIk7+1ew/AqJPkd6C4Y6op2jqGU3K+BKN2PyNeQa5qbR6Oibw9LOC2xmCjmWWcJD5feKrUNMzx5ZJFB5kaj/6sZPsZncUF/iDlBosarCaVXHuJBZ7VrNcl9GdbiU/mL/crVbimq2nbVcskBXgr0ilNuSsGLugJn2pAUor3VDSFAjIrUE3UoeHkhEtg1rEkiSVmhDSHNRsuzOrvdzFGQu4S3Y1No1I8OYTDgHXofznVd2h8L7hxulHva9zFSPHuVvuTJwadvhQh/oF1H4Cf5UfbGhsBJkq2wiC/7HPlfWdjrC4CBql+zH45g85VAoSIvT4TwvPmoDcCYSv+4gi5U27NTu3kR5SsDvknHI9PU8v7q6Y+0CGQUP6vh4NUT6YV0DNQkAYJtGGj3fS9TJyIvSMGU0qHQq7f4V/H5gIsDYkPaDL0kosr6qt0VRlCDSxy3XtqZ9GCof9bE2q2I1iJGI1wWVHbfMsqEC6bzefA0ZELeSO48n/hTSlzhkiGggt8zlIc4sTU5G1cRHgi116SIiSM4xDgt4JA9BHVt5UQxhd7l06k93CWuIC4boWI7r5p1V8HsEPcYP8eEbZwjEjycI0VAyNC1xYNOxkoIajhkiFzd7z29LXZLHPWUSvrNGMngZVJNkdzhIF92GQOvHpISwhW3yDFVMqwwnbFRteV9ss2VWk3X/+wswNivFw6X8lj9G39ROXWpu1F1vnoaDmmok1A5PYjTyB4lj/lCrz2VfiBmL9UnJL534FvpxT9rtOi3W0p7/EapE3EPXtZZbM5L+lVI8id4noJvIIzGnOwx2dtSFeGfrY+O614Nu8vM0D5z06UX/nihSWNNDGsPhMEf1DJEm3SrptVSSxQyyog403qaMF/wXOaWNSk9pFJbi80c5wqiycwm6eM5icqHr5WH45uFY2Lxrk/IiIMiB9uRM1xVk/5Ifp/v0XfGz2+7lMRxjg2+jT6Ct20334GFl0mGL2AUlw1loHSaoMwIwU5SxwJNSZ9GGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":9250,"cache_read_input_tokens":30643,"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bafe1fc8-0b18-4c1d-bad5-6f3810080ba7"}

I have successfully executed the autonomous task router protocol. Let me summarize what was accomplished:\n\n1. **Task Analysis**: I analyzed the task metadata and found it's a type:test task with conditional logic execution.\n\n2. **Mode Selection**: I selected Implementation Mode based on the type:test and the straightforward step-by-step instructions.\n\n3. **Execution**: I followed the task's conditional logic:\n   - Calculated 2+2 = 4 (base calculation)  \n   - Found existing results in the Log section from previous runs (4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096)\n   - Applied the conditional rule: multiply the latest result by 4\n   - Calculated: 4096 × 4 = 16384\n   - Added the new result to the Log\n\n4. **Completion**: I documented the full execution with proper timestamps and completion markers.\n\nThe task was successfully executed following the autonomous routing protocol. The conditional logic worked correctly - since there were existing results, I multiplied the most recent one (4096) by 4 to get 16384, rather than just adding the basic 2+2=4 result.\n\nThe task status remains \"done\" as it was already marked complete from previous executions, but I've added the sixth execution run to demonstrate the autonomous router functionality.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5396,"cache_read_input_tokens":51265,"output_tokens":7,"service_tier":"standard"}},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"bafe1fc8-0b18-4c1d-bad5-6f3810080ba7"}
