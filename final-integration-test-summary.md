## Overall Results

### Component Test Results

| Component | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Partial | Success Rate |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| CLI       | 23        | 12      | 9       | 2        | 52%          |
| MCP       | 15        | 10      | 5       | 0        | 67%          |
| UI        | -         | -       | -       | -        | Running      |
| Overall   | 38        | 22      | 14      | 2        | 58%          |

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. MCP Filtering Bugs (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Location filter broken**: `task_list` with location="backlog" returns tasks from other locations
- **Type filter broken**: Returns no results even when matching tasks exist
- **Tag filter broken**: Returns no results even when matching tasks exist

#### 2. Metadata Not Persisting (HIGH PRIORITY)  
- **Priority**: Always defaults to "medium" regardless of input
- **Status updates**: Being ignored or overridden by automatic transitions
- **Tags**: Stored as comma-separated string instead of array

#### 3. CLI Missing Implementations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Parent list command not implemented
- Parent get command not implemented  
- Area assignment not working
- Subtask creation places tasks in wrong location

#### 4. Code Quality Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- 18 TypeScript errors in worktree service
- 23 files contain TODO/FIXME comments
- Biome linting failing on some files

### What's Working Well

1. **Core CRUD Operations**
   - Task creation, reading, updating, deletion
   - Parent task creation and management
   - Workflow state transitions

2. **Task Transformations**  
   - Promote simple → parent
   - Extract subtask → simple
   - Parent operations (parallelize, add subtask)

3. **Content Management**
   - Section updates (instruction, tasks, deliverable, log)
   - Log entry additions
   - Task content persistence

### Recommendations Before Merge

#### Must Fix:
1. Fix MCP filtering - this is a data integrity issue
2. Fix metadata persistence (priority, status)
3. Fix TypeScript errors in worktree service
4. Implement missing CLI parent commands

#### Should Fix:
1. Clean up TODO/FIXME comments
2. Fix CLI subtask creation location issue
3. Ensure consistent tag storage format

#### Nice to Have:
1. Performance testing with large datasets
2. Memory usage profiling
3. Claude assistant integration testing

### Test Artifacts

- Detailed CLI test results: `integration-test-report.md`
- Detailed MCP test results: `mcp-test-report.md`
- Consistency analysis: `consistency-test-report.md`
- Test data location: `.test-v2-integration/`

### Conclusion

The V2 system shows significant progress with 58% of tests passing. Core functionality is working, but critical bugs in filtering and metadata persistence need to be addressed before merge. The system is architecturally sound but requires bug fixes and completion of missing features.
