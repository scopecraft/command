# Scopecraft Orchestration & Automation Vision

## Overview

This document outlines the long-term vision for Scopecraft's orchestration and automation capabilities, building upon the Phase 1 foundation of Docker-enabled session management.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. AI-Native Development Workflow
Scopecraft represents a paradigm shift from traditional development tools to an AI-native workflow where:
- **Tasks are the primary unit of work**, not code files or tickets
- **AI agents are first-class citizens**, not just assistants
- **Automation is the default**, manual intervention is the exception
- **Context is preserved and propagated** across all interactions

### 2. Progressive Autonomy
The system should support a spectrum of autonomy levels:
- **Guided**: Human drives, AI assists (current state)
- **Collaborative**: Human and AI work together in real-time
- **Supervised**: AI works autonomously with human checkpoints
- **Autonomous**: AI completes tasks independently (target state)

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Docker-First Execution
All AI operations run in containerized environments because:
- **Safety**: Isolates potentially dangerous operations
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across all executions
- **Permissions**: Enables full filesystem and git access
- **Scalability**: Easy to distribute across machines

### 2. Session Unification
A single session abstraction that supports:
- **Multiple modes**: Autonomous, interactive, dispatch (parallel tmux), planning, orchestration
- **Multiple environments**: Docker containers, TMux sessions, worktrees
- **Multiple interfaces**: CLI, MCP, UI, API
- **Multiple contexts**: Tasks, features, projects

### 3. Hybrid Storage Architecture
Separate runtime state from historical data:
- **Runtime State** (`~/.scopecraft/`): Active sessions, queues, monitoring
- **Historical State** (`.tasks/` in git): Completed sessions, decisions, artifacts
- **Worktree Awareness**: Tasks exist per-branch, sessions know their context

This separation enables:
- Clean dashboard implementation (single source for runtime)
- Git-based collaboration (shareable history)
- Multi-developer evolution (clear boundaries)

### 4. Worktree-First Execution
Every session must execute in the appropriate git worktree:
- **Task-Worktree Binding**: Sessions for a task run in that task's branch worktree
- **Automatic Resolution**: System finds or creates the right worktree before execution
- **No Main Branch Execution**: Prevents accidental changes to main branch
- **Convention-Based**: `feature/auth-05A` branch owns tasks ending in `-05A`

This ensures:
- Proper branch isolation for all changes
- Parallel development without conflicts
- Clear ownership of task implementations

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture
Everything is an event:
- **Session lifecycle**: Created, started, completed, failed
- **Task progress**: Status changes, log entries, costs
- **System health**: Queue depth, resource usage, errors
- **Human interactions**: Feedback, approvals, corrections

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 2: Multi-Interface Support (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Enable orchestration through CLI, MCP, and UI

Including support for:
- Autonomous sessions (Docker-based background execution)
- Dispatch sessions (TMux-based parallel interactive)
- Unified interface across all modes

#### Unified CLI Commands
```bash
# New unified CLI commands
scopecraft session start <taskId> [options]
  --mode autonomous|dispatch|interactive|planning|orchestration
  --worktree <branch>     # Create/use git worktree
  --dangerous             # Enable dangerous operations
  --priority high|normal  # Queue priority
  --parent <parentId>     # Parent task context

scopecraft session list [--active|--queued|--all]
scopecraft session logs <sessionId> [--follow]
scopecraft session cancel <sessionId>
scopecraft session continue <sessionId> "feedback"
scopecraft session attach <sessionId>  # For dispatch/interactive sessions
```

#### MCP Integration
```typescript
// New MCP methods
session_create(params: SessionCreateParams) -> UnifiedSession
session_list(filter?: SessionFilter) -> UnifiedSession[]
session_get(sessionId: string) -> UnifiedSession
session_cancel(sessionId: string) -> boolean
session_continue(sessionId: string, feedback: string) -> boolean
session_logs(sessionId: string, limit?: number) -> LogEntry[]
```

### Phase 3: Additional Session Types (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Implement remaining executors

#### Interactive Sessions (TMux)
```typescript
class InteractiveExecutor extends BaseExecutor {
  async create(options: CreateSessionOptions) {
    const sessionName = `claude-${options.taskId}-${Date.now()}`;
    
    // Create TMux session
    await exec(`tmux new-session -d -s ${sessionName}`);
    
    // Start Claude in TMux (no Docker for interactive)
    const command = this.buildInteractiveCommand(options);
    await exec(`tmux send-keys -t ${sessionName} "${command}" Enter`);
    
    return this.createSessionRecord(sessionName, options);
  }
}
```

#### Planning & Orchestration Modes
- **Planning**: One-off Docker runs with specialized prompts
- **Orchestration**: Meta-sessions that can spawn child sessions

### Phase 4: Advanced Queue & Resource Management (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Production-grade queue with advanced features

#### Priority Queue Implementation
```typescript
interface QueuePolicy {
  maxConcurrent: Record<SessionMode, number>;
  maxQueueSize: number;
  priorityWeights: Record<Priority, number>;
  fairnessPolicy: 'fifo' | 'round-robin' | 'weighted';
}

class PriorityQueue extends SimpleQueue {
  async enqueue(item: QueueItem): Promise<QueuedSession> {
    // Add to appropriate priority lane
    const lane = this.lanes.get(item.priority);
    lane.push(item);
    
    // Process based on policy
    return this.processWithPolicy();
  }
}
```

#### Resource Management
- CPU and memory limits per session type
- Cost budgets with automatic pausing
- Concurrent session limits by area/team
- Resource reservation for critical tasks

### Phase 5: Worktree Lifecycle Management (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal**: Seamless git worktree integration

```typescript
class WorktreeOrchestrator {
  async executeInWorktree(session: UnifiedSession) {
    // Create or reuse worktree
    const worktreePath = await this.prepareWorktree(session);
    
    // Execute session in worktree context
    const result = await this.executeSession(session, worktreePath);
    
    // Cleanup based on policy
    if (this.shouldCleanup(session)) {
      await this.cleanupWorktree(worktreePath);
    }
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

## Cloud Execution Strategy

Leverage existing CI/PR infrastructure for cloud execution without additional infrastructure:

### CI-Based Autonomous Sessions
```yaml
# Triggered by PR comment: @scopecraft implement feature-xyz
name: Scopecraft Cloud Session
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  orchestrate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: my-claude:authenticated
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Scopecraft Session
        run: |
          scopecraft session start ${{ env.TASK_ID }} \
            --mode autonomous \
            --environment CI
```

### Storage Adapter Pattern
```typescript
interface StorageAdapter {
  saveSession(session: Session): Promise<void>
  getSession(id: string): Promise<Session>
  listSessions(): Promise<Session[]>
  updateStatus(id: string, status: SessionStatus): Promise<void>
}

// Implementations
class LocalStorageAdapter {
  // Stores in ~/.scopecraft/
  constructor(private basePath = '~/.scopecraft') {}
}

class CIStorageAdapter {
  // Stores as PR comments and artifacts
  constructor(private github: GitHubClient) {}
  
  async updateStatus(id: string, status: SessionStatus) {
    await this.github.createComment({
      body: `ðŸ¤– Session ${id}: ${status}\n${new Date().toISOString()}`
    });
  }
}

// Automatic selection based on environment
const adapter = process.env.CI 
  ? new CIStorageAdapter(github) 
  : new LocalStorageAdapter();
```

This approach provides:
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Uses existing CI/PR systems
- **Natural Audit Trail**: All updates in PR history
- **Access Control**: Leverages GitHub permissions
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for CI minutes
