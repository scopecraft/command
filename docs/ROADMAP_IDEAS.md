# Scopecraft Command - Roadmap and Feature Ideas

This document captures ideas and potential future features for the Scopecraft Command project. These are not formal tasks but rather a collection of thoughts to consider for future development.

## üå† Feature Ideas

### Idea: TomLMD Template for Ideas/Roadmap

- **Description**: Create a dedicated template type for capturing ideas and roadmap items without creating formal tasks
- **Value**: Provides a structured way to capture ideas without cluttering the task system
- **Status**: New
- **Notes**: Could be implemented as a new template type in the templates directory

### Idea: Claude Code Integration Epic

- **Description**: Create first-party support for Claude Code with custom slash commands for task management
- **Value**: Streamlines task management directly within Claude Code, improving developer workflow and productivity
- **Status**: New
- **Notes**:
  - Implement a one-time setup command (`sc claude-init`) that generates Claude-specific slash commands
  - Focus on core workflows: task creation, viewing, updating, and completion
  - Generated commands include: `/task:create`, `/task:start`, `/task:complete`, `/task:next`
  - Commands should be project-aware and read from existing task configuration
  - Generated commands get committed to version control for team sharing
  - Could potentially serve as a model for other AI assistant integrations in the future

### Idea: Progressive Task State Management

- **Description**: Implement a multi-phase approach to task state management enabling increasingly sophisticated Claude Code integration
- **Value**: Enables persistence across Claude sessions, improves task continuity, and unlocks parallel task execution
- **Status**: New
- **Notes**:
  - **Phase 1: File-Based Single Task Session**
    - Implement `.current-task.json` for tracking active task state
    - Store progress markers, implementation notes, and file changes
    - Support Claude Code slash commands for basic task operations
    - Enable continuous work across multiple Claude sessions

  - **Phase 2: Orchestrator with Sequential Tasks**
    - Create a "task orchestrator" mode for Claude
    - Allow spawning headless Claude instances for individual tasks
    - Maintain a task queue with priority ordering
    - Use file-based system for communication between instances
    - Execute tasks sequentially (one at a time) to avoid conflicts

  - **Phase 3: Full Parallel Orchestration**
    - Develop a lightweight server for task state management
    - Leverage git worktrees for parallel task execution
    - Implement a message bus for inter-agent communication
    - Add dependency resolution and conflict detection
    - Enable true parallel execution with resource management
    - Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines for automated testing

### Idea: Task-Adaptive Mode System

- **Description**: Create a system of specialized Claude Code modes that adapt to different task types and contexts
- **Value**: Optimizes Claude's capabilities for specific task types, improving productivity and output quality
- **Status**: New
- **Notes**:
  - Implement modes for common task types:
    - Code Review Mode (analysis, feedback, suggestions)
    - Feature Development Mode (implementation, testing)
    - Bug Fix Mode (diagnosis, repair, verification)
    - Documentation Mode (writing, updating, formatting)

  - Integrate with MDTM task system:
    - Task templates define recommended modes
    - Modes automatically switch based on task type
    - Leverage MDTM's mode delegation field in frontmatter
    - Store mode-specific task history and context

  - Mode components include:
    - Custom slash commands relevant to the mode
    - Pre-configured tool permissions
    - Specialized MCP server access
    - Task-specific system prompts and context

  - Compatibility features:
    - Support importing from RooCode mode definitions
    - Extend with task-specific enhancements
    - Allow customization of modes per project
    - Track which modes were used during task execution

## üîÑ Process for Managing Ideas

1. Add new ideas to this document in the appropriate section
2. Periodically review and update status
3. When ready to implement, create a formal task using appropriate templates
4. Update status in this document when implementation is complete

## üìù Notes

- This document is not intended to be a formal task list but rather a collection of ideas to consider
- Feel free to add, modify, or remove ideas as needed
- Regular review of this document can help prioritize future development efforts
