# Claude-Code-Flow Prompt Analysis (v1.0.72)

## Overview

This analysis examines the sophisticated prompt engineering patterns in Claude-Code-Flow's SPARC framework and swarm orchestration system.

## 1. SPARC Prompt Architecture

### Core Pattern

The SPARC system uses a multi-layered prompt construction approach:

```typescript
buildSparcPrompt(mode, taskDescription, flags) {
  return `
    # SPARC Development Mode: ${mode.name}
    
    ## Your Role
    ${mode.roleDefinition}
    
    ## Your Task
    ${taskDescription}
    
    ## Mode-Specific Instructions
    ${mode.customInstructions}
    
    ## SPARC Development Environment
    [Environment details, tools, methodology]
  `
}
```

### Key Components

1. **Role Definition**: Clear, single-sentence role statement
2. **Task Description**: User-provided objective
3. **Mode-Specific Instructions**: Tailored guidance per mode
4. **Environment Context**: Tools, memory integration, best practices

## 2. SPARC Mode Patterns

### Analyzed Modes

#### Orchestrator
```
You are an AI orchestrator that coordinates multiple specialized agents to complete complex tasks efficiently.
```
- **Focus**: Multi-agent coordination
- **Tools**: TodoWrite, TodoRead, Task, Memory, Bash
- **Pattern**: Centralized control with task distribution

#### Coder
```
You are an expert programmer focused on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code using batch file operations.
```
- **Focus**: Implementation with batch optimization
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, TodoWrite
- **Pattern**: File operation batching for efficiency

#### TDD
```
You follow strict test-driven development practices using TodoWrite for test planning and batch operations for test execution.
```
- **Focus**: Test-first development
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite, Task
- **Pattern**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement

### Common Patterns Across Modes

1. **Role Clarity**: Each mode starts with "You are..." establishing clear identity
2. **Tool Specialization**: Tools matched to role requirements
3. **Batch Optimization**: Emphasis on parallel/batch operations
4. **Memory Integration**: All modes use Memory for coordination
5. **TodoWrite Centrality**: Task management as core coordination mechanism

## 3. Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Role-Based Personification
- Each agent has a specific professional identity
- Roles are action-oriented (orchestrator, coder, debugger)
- Clear boundaries of responsibility

### 2. Tool-Task Alignment
```javascript
// Example from coder mode
tools: ["Read","Write","Edit","Bash","Glob","Grep","TodoWrite"]
// Matches file manipulation needs
```

### 3. Memory-First Coordination
Every mode includes:
```bash
# Store your progress
npx claude-flow memory store ${namespace}_progress "Current status"

# Check for previous work
npx claude-flow memory query ${namespace}
```

### 4. Workflow Context Injection
```typescript
${flags.workflowStep ? `
**Workflow Progress**: Step ${flags.workflowStep} of ${flags.totalSteps}
- Review previous steps: \`npx claude-flow memory query previous_steps\`
- Store this step's output: \`npx claude-flow memory store step_${flags.workflowStep}_output "<results>"\`
` : ''}
```

### 5. Best Practices Embedding
Each prompt includes:
- Modular development (files under 500 lines)
- Environment safety (no hardcoded secrets)
- Memory usage patterns
- Tool integration guidance

## 4. Advanced Prompt Features

### Dynamic Context Building
- Workflow step tracking
- TDD phase awareness
- Namespace isolation for parallel work

### Tool Group Mapping
```typescript
const toolMappings: Record<string, string[]> = {
  read: ["View", "LS", "GlobTool", "GrepTool"],
  edit: ["Edit", "Replace", "MultiEdit", "Write"],
  browser: ["WebFetch"],
  mcp: ["mcp_tools"],
  command: ["Bash", "Terminal"]
};
```

### SPARC Methodology Integration
- Explicit methodology phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
- Phase-specific instructions
- Cross-mode communication via memory

## 5. Swarm Coordination Patterns

### Agent Types
```typescript
type: 'researcher' | 'developer' | 'analyzer' | 'coordinator' | 'reviewer'
```

### Task Distribution
- Priority-based scheduling
- Dependency management
- Capability matching

### Coordination Strategies
1. **Auto**: System determines best approach
2. **Research**: Information gathering focus
3. **Development**: Implementation focus
4. **Analysis**: Data processing focus

## 6. Key Innovations

### 1. Batch Operation Emphasis
- All modes encourage batch file operations
- Reduces overhead of multiple tool calls
- Improves efficiency

### 2. Memory as Communication Bus
- Shared namespace for coordination
- Persistent state across sessions
- Query capabilities for discovery

### 3. TodoWrite as Task Graph
- Visual task management
- Dependency tracking
- Progress monitoring

### 4. Mode Composition
- TDD workflow chains multiple modes
- Each mode builds on previous outputs
- Memory maintains continuity

### 5. Instance Isolation
```typescript
const instanceId = `sparc-${modeSlug}-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
```

## 7. Learnings for Scopecraft

### Applicable Patterns

1. **Role-Based Modes**: Create specialized modes for different task types
   - Task Creator Mode
   - Architecture Review Mode
   - Documentation Mode
   - Worktree Management Mode

2. **Memory-First Approach**: Enhance session storage with query capabilities
   - Add search/query to session data
   - Enable cross-session knowledge sharing
   - Build coordination protocols

3. **Batch Operations**: Optimize file operations
   - Group related task operations
   - Batch worktree operations
   - Parallel subtask processing

4. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: Context-aware prompts
   - Include workflow state
   - Inject task relationships
   - Add progress tracking

5. **Tool Specialization**: Match tools to task types
   - Feature tasks: full tool access
   - Bug tasks: debugging-focused tools
   - Documentation tasks: read/write focused

### Implementation Ideas

1. **Scopecraft SPARC Modes**:
   ```typescript
   // Task Planning Mode
   "You are a task architect who breaks down features into well-structured subtasks following Scopecraft's workflow patterns."
   
   // Worktree Orchestrator Mode
   "You are a worktree coordinator managing parallel development across multiple git worktrees efficiently."
   ```

2. **Enhanced Task Context**:
   ```typescript
   ## Current Task Context
   - Parent: ${task.parent}
   - Siblings: ${task.siblings}
   - Workflow State: ${task.workflowState}
   - Session History: ${sessions.length} previous sessions
   ```

3. **Coordination Patterns**:
   - Use task IDs as memory namespaces
   - Store session outcomes in task log
   - Enable cross-task knowledge queries

## 8. Architecture Insights

### Separation of Concerns
- Prompt building separate from execution
- Mode configuration in JSON files
- Tool mapping abstracted

### Extensibility
- New modes easily added via JSON
- Tool groups composable
- Workflow definitions shareable

### User Experience
- Dry-run capability for preview
- Progress indicators
- Clear instance tracking

## Conclusion

Claude-Code-Flow's prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated patterns for AI agent coordination:

1. **Clear role definition** drives agent behavior
2. **Memory integration** enables complex coordination
3. **Batch optimization** improves efficiency
4. **Dynamic context** provides situational awareness
5. **Tool specialization** matches capabilities to needs

These patterns can significantly enhance Scopecraft's task orchestration and session management capabilities while maintaining its Unix philosophy and file-based simplicity.
