## Quick Reference

### Claude-Code-Flow v1.0.72 Key Features
- **17 SPARC Modes**: Specialized AI agents with role-based prompts
- **Memory-First Coordination**: CLI-based memory sharing via file backends
- **VS Code Integration**: Programmatic terminal spawning and control
- **Production Features**: Extended timeouts, auto-configuration, NPX distribution
- **Batch Operations**: Parallel file operations for efficiency

### Major Architectural Patterns
1. **Role-Based Specialization**: Fixed professional identities vs customizable templates
2. **CLI Memory Coordination**: `npx claude-flow memory store/query` commands (not MCP tools!)
3. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: Context injection with workflow awareness
4. **Tool Group Specialization**: Role-matched tool configurations
5. **Complexity-Driven Orchestration**: ML-inspired algorithms for task routing and agent selection
6. **No Git Automation**: Focuses on AI coordination, not version control automation

### Scopecraft Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Memory Query Layer**: Add search capabilities to session storage
2. **Specialized Modes**: Create role-specific templates (researcher, coder, reviewer)
3. **Batch Operations**: Group file operations for efficiency
4. **CLI Memory Commands**: Enable cross-task knowledge sharing
5. **VS Code Integration**: Optional terminal orchestration for worktrees
