# Scopecraft Orchestration & Automation Vision

## Overview

This document outlines the long-term vision for Scopecraft's orchestration and automation capabilities, building upon the Phase 1 foundation of Docker-enabled session management.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. AI-Native Development Workflow
Scopecraft represents a paradigm shift from traditional development tools to an AI-native workflow where:
- **Tasks are the primary unit of work**, not code files or tickets
- **AI agents are first-class citizens**, not just assistants
- **Automation is the default**, manual intervention is the exception
- **Context is preserved and propagated** across all interactions

### 2. Progressive Autonomy
The system should support a spectrum of autonomy levels:
- **Guided**: Human drives, AI assists (current state)
- **Collaborative**: Human and AI work together in real-time
- **Supervised**: AI works autonomously with human checkpoints
- **Autonomous**: AI completes tasks independently (target state)

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Docker-First Execution
All AI operations run in containerized environments because:
- **Safety**: Isolates potentially dangerous operations
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across all executions
- **Permissions**: Enables full filesystem and git access
- **Scalability**: Easy to distribute across machines

### 2. Session Unification
A single session abstraction that supports:
- **Multiple modes**: Autonomous, interactive, planning, orchestration
- **Multiple environments**: Docker containers, TMux sessions, worktrees
- **Multiple interfaces**: CLI, MCP, UI, API
- **Multiple contexts**: Tasks, features, projects

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
Everything is an event:
- **Session lifecycle**: Created, started, completed, failed
- **Task progress**: Status changes, log entries, costs
- **System health**: Queue depth, resource usage, errors
- **Human interactions**: Feedback, approvals, corrections

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 2: Multi-Interface Support (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Enable orchestration through CLI, MCP, and UI

#### Unified CLI Commands
```bash
# New unified CLI commands
scopecraft session start <taskId> [options]
  --mode autonomous|interactive|planning|orchestration
  --worktree <branch>     # Create/use git worktree
  --dangerous             # Enable dangerous operations
  --priority high|normal  # Queue priority
  --parent <parentId>     # Parent task context

scopecraft session list [--active|--queued|--all]
scopecraft session logs <sessionId> [--follow]
scopecraft session cancel <sessionId>
scopecraft session continue <sessionId> "feedback"
```

#### MCP Integration
```typescript
// New MCP methods
session_create(params: SessionCreateParams) -> UnifiedSession
session_list(filter?: SessionFilter) -> UnifiedSession[]
session_get(sessionId: string) -> UnifiedSession
session_cancel(sessionId: string) -> boolean
session_continue(sessionId: string, feedback: string) -> boolean
session_logs(sessionId: string, limit?: number) -> LogEntry[]
```

### Phase 3: Additional Session Types (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Implement remaining executors

#### Interactive Sessions (TMux)
```typescript
class InteractiveExecutor extends BaseExecutor {
  async create(options: CreateSessionOptions) {
    const sessionName = `claude-${options.taskId}-${Date.now()}`;
    
    // Create TMux session
    await exec(`tmux new-session -d -s ${sessionName}`);
    
    // Start Claude in TMux (no Docker for interactive)
    const command = this.buildInteractiveCommand(options);
    await exec(`tmux send-keys -t ${sessionName} "${command}" Enter`);
    
    return this.createSessionRecord(sessionName, options);
  }
}
```

#### Planning & Orchestration Modes
- **Planning**: One-off Docker runs with specialized prompts
- **Orchestration**: Meta-sessions that can spawn child sessions

### Phase 4: Advanced Queue & Resource Management (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Production-grade queue with advanced features

#### Priority Queue Implementation
```typescript
interface QueuePolicy {
  maxConcurrent: Record<SessionMode, number>;
  maxQueueSize: number;
  priorityWeights: Record<Priority, number>;
  fairnessPolicy: 'fifo' | 'round-robin' | 'weighted';
}

class PriorityQueue extends SimpleQueue {
  async enqueue(item: QueueItem): Promise<QueuedSession> {
    // Add to appropriate priority lane
    const lane = this.lanes.get(item.priority);
    lane.push(item);
    
    // Process based on policy
    return this.processWithPolicy();
  }
}
```

#### Resource Management
- CPU and memory limits per session type
- Cost budgets with automatic pausing
- Concurrent session limits by area/team
- Resource reservation for critical tasks

### Phase 5: Worktree Lifecycle Management (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal**: Seamless git worktree integration

```typescript
class WorktreeOrchestrator {
  async executeInWorktree(session: UnifiedSession) {
    // Create or reuse worktree
    const worktreePath = await this.prepareWorktree(session);
    
    // Execute session in worktree context
    const result = await this.executeSession(session, worktreePath);
    
    // Cleanup based on policy
    if (this.shouldCleanup(session)) {
      await this.cleanupWorktree(worktreePath);
    }
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

## Long-Term Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Orchestration (6-12 months)

  constraints: {
    deadline: "2024-02-01",
    budget: 50.00,
    quality: "production"
  }
});
// AI breaks down into tasks, determines dependencies,
// schedules parallel execution, monitors progress
```

#### Adaptive Prompt Engineering
- Dynamic prompt selection based on task context

  REVIEWER = 'reviewer',        // Code review
  TESTER = 'tester',           // Test creation
  DOCUMENTER = 'documenter'    // Documentation
}

// Agents collaborate on complex features
orchestrator.deployTeam({
  feature: "payment-processing",
  agents: [
    { role: AgentRole.ARCHITECT, model: 'opus' },
    { role: AgentRole.IMPLEMENTER, model: 'sonnet', count: 2 },

## Conclusion

Scopecraft's orchestration and automation vision represents a fundamental shift in software development. By combining Docker-isolated execution, unified session management, and progressive automation, we're building a platform where AI agents become true development partners.

The journey from Phase 1's Docker-enabled sessions to full autonomous development will be incremental but transformative. Each phase builds on the previous, maintaining backward compatibility while pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

The key to success is starting with a solid foundation (Phase 1), then progressively adding capabilities based on real-world usage and feedback. By maintaining flexibility in our architecture while staying true to our core principles, Scopecraft will evolve into the definitive platform for AI-native software development.
