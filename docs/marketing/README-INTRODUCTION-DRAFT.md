# Scopecraft Command

> **Professional task management for AI-assisted development teams**

Scopecraft Command transforms how development teams organize and track work in AI-first workflows. Built with a **local-first, filesystem-based** approach using Markdown files, it provides both a powerful CLI and an MCP server that integrates seamlessly with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Why Scopecraft Command?

**Local-First Task Management That Scales**

Unlike cloud-based project management tools, Scopecraft Command keeps everything in your repository as readable Markdown files. No servers, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in - just your tasks living alongside your code.

## Core Features

### üè† **Local-First & Privacy-Focused**
- **Filesystem-Based**: All tasks stored as Markdown files in your repository
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Works completely offline, no external servers required
- **Version Controlled**: Tasks track with your code using standard git workflows
- **Readable Format**: Plain Markdown files you can edit with any text editor

### ü§ñ **AI Workflow Orchestration**
- **MCP Server Integration**: Works natively with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI tools
- **AI Mode Management**: Coordinate different AI agents across planning, implementation, and review phases
- **Intelligent Task Breakdown**: AI-assisted feature planning and task decomposition
- **Workflow Commands**: Built-in commands for plan ‚Üí implement ‚Üí review cycles
- **Boomerang-Style Tasks**: Tasks that intelligently route between different AI specializations
- **Standalone Fallback**: Full functionality without AI dependencies when needed

### üå≥ **Git Worktree Management & Multi-Agent Coordination**
- **Automated Worktree Creation**: Launch separate development environments per task/feature
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track changes, commits, and progress across all active worktrees
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Deploy different AI agents on separate features simultaneously
- **Branch-Task Correlation**: Automatic linking between git branches and task metadata
- **Conflict Prevention**: Isolate work streams to prevent merge conflicts

### üìÅ **Professional Project Organization**
- **Feature & Area Management**: Organize work by features, components, and focus areas
- **Phase-Based Workflows**: Structure releases and sprints with built-in phase support
- **Complex Relationships**: Handle dependencies, parent-child tasks, and workflow sequences
- **Multiple Project Support**: Switch between projects with ease

## Perfect for Teams Who Value Control

**Solo Developers**: Keep your tasks private and orchestrate AI workflows locally
**Small Teams**: Share tasks through git while coordinating AI agent work
**Privacy-Conscious Teams**: No data leaves your infrastructure
**AI-First Teams**: Sophisticated agent coordination without cloud dependencies

## Notes for Implementation

This introduction positions Scopecraft Command as:

1. **Local-first alternative** to cloud task management
2. **Sophisticated AI coordination platform** beyond simple chat integration
3. **Professional tool** that scales from solo to team use
4. **Privacy-focused solution** for teams who want control

### Key messaging themes:
- **Local control** vs cloud dependency
- **AI orchestration** vs basic AI chat
- **Professional scaling** vs simple task lists
- **Filesystem-based** vs proprietary formats

### Features highlighted:
- ‚úÖ Local-first approach (implemented)
- ‚úÖ CLI and MCP server (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Git worktree management (implemented)
- ‚úÖ Professional project organization (implemented)
- üöß AI workflow orchestration (in development)
- üöß Mode management (in development)
