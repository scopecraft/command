# Feature Management MCP Tools

This document provides comprehensive descriptions of Feature management tools available in the Scopecraft Command MCP server. Features represent major work items or epics that organize complex functionality into manageable subtasks.

## Overview

Feature tools provide CRUD operations for managing features within the MDTM system. Features are subdirectories within phases that group related tasks together. They're perfect for organizing epic-level work that needs to be broken down into smaller, actionable tasks. Each feature has an `_overview.md` file that describes the feature's purpose and tracks its overall progress.

## Key Concepts

- **Features as Epics**: Features serve as containers for complex work that spans multiple tasks
- **Directory Structure**: Features are directories with "FEATURE_" prefix (e.g., "FEATURE_Authentication")
- **Overview Files**: Each feature has an `_overview.md` file that acts as the feature's main documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: Feature progress is automatically calculated from its subtasks
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Phase â†’ Feature â†’ Tasks

## Tools

### feature_list

Lists all features in the project with optional filtering and progress tracking.

**Purpose**: Get an overview of all features across phases or within a specific phase. Essential for understanding project scope and tracking feature-level progress.

**When to use**:
- To see all major features in development
- To check feature progress across the project
- To filter features by status or phase
- For project planning and status reports

**Parameters**:
- `phase` (optional): Filter by phase ID (e.g., "release-v1")
  - Only shows features within the specified phase
- `status` (optional): Filter by feature status
  - Feature status can be explicitly set or calculated from tasks
  - Common values: "ðŸŸ¡ To Do", "ðŸ”µ In Progress", "ðŸŸ¢ Done"
- `include_tasks` (optional): Include task details in response (boolean, default: false)
  - When true, returns all task IDs within each feature
  - Useful for getting a complete feature breakdown
- `include_progress` (optional): Include progress percentage (boolean, default: true)
  - Calculates completion based on done vs total tasks
- `format` (optional): Output format (reserved for future use)

**Returns**: Array of feature objects with:
- `id`: Feature directory name (e.g., "FEATURE_Authentication")
- `name`: Clean feature name (e.g., "Authentication")
- `title`: Feature title from overview file
- `description`: Feature description
- `phase`: Which phase contains this feature
- `status`: Current feature status

## Best Practices

### 1. **Feature Naming**
- Use descriptive, consistent names
- PascalCase or snake_case (avoid spaces)
- Examples: "UserAuthentication", "PaymentGateway", "DataMigration"

### 2. **Feature Organization**
- One feature = one major piece of functionality
- Keep features focused and cohesive
- Break large features into multiple smaller ones if needed

### 3. **Overview Files**
- Keep overview files updated with current goals
- Document acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Include high-level design decisions

### 4. **Task Management**
- Create tasks within features using `subdirectory` parameter
- Use consistent task ID prefixes (e.g., "AUTH-001", "AUTH-002")
- Link related tasks with dependencies

### 5. **Progress Tracking**
- Feature progress auto-calculates from task completion
- Update feature status to reflect actual state
- Use tags to mark priority features

## Common Patterns

### Creating a feature with initial tasks
```json
// 1. Create the feature
{
  "method": "feature_create",
  "params": {
    "name": "UserProfile",
    "title": "User Profile Management",
    "phase": "release-v1",
    "description": "Allow users to manage their profile information"
  }
}

// 2. Add tasks to the feature
{
  "method": "task_create",
  "params": {
    "id": "PROF-001",
    "title": "Design profile UI mockups",
    "type": "ðŸŒŸ Feature",
    "phase": "release-v1",
    "subdirectory": "FEATURE_UserProfile"
  }
}
```

### Epic breakdown workflow
```json
// 1. Create the epic/feature
{
  "method": "feature_create",
  "params": {
    "name": "PaymentSystem",
    "title": "Complete Payment System",
    "phase": "release-v2",
    "description": "Full payment processing with multiple gateways"
  }
}

// 2. Create subtasks for different aspects
// - Payment gateway integration
// - Shopping cart
// - Order processing
// - Receipt generation
```

### Feature status progression
```json
// Start development
{
  "method": "feature_update",
  "params": {
    "id": "Authentication",
    "updates": { "status": "ðŸ”µ In Progress" }
  }
}

// Complete feature
{
  "method": "feature_update",
  "params": {
    "id": "Authentication",
    "updates": { 
      "status": "ðŸŸ¢ Done",
      "description": "Completed: All authentication features implemented and tested"
    }
  }
}
```

## Relationship to Other Tools

- **Tasks**: Create tasks within features using the `subdirectory` parameter
- **Phases**: Features exist within phases as subdirectories
- **Areas**: Features are for product functionality; areas are for cross-cutting concerns
- **Move**: Use `task_move` to reorganize tasks between features
- **Workflow**: Feature status affects task discovery and suggestions
