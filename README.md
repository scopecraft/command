# Scopecraft Command

A comprehensive toolset for managing Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files. This project provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for working with tasks directly.

**Key Features:**
* Works both with and without Roo Commander
* Supports the standardized MDTM format (with TOML/YAML frontmatter)
* Automatically detects project type and adapts accordingly
* Provides direct CRUD operations on task files without requiring LLM processing

## Architecture

The project is organized into three main components:

1. **Core** - Core task management functionality shared by both CLI and MCP server
   - Features a modular architecture with task operations split into focused modules
   - Each module has a single responsibility (e.g., task-crud.ts, phase-crud.ts, task-relationships.ts) 
2. **CLI** - Command-line interface for interacting with tasks
3. **MCP** - MCP-compatible server for integration with Roo Commander LLMs

The system supports the [MDTM directory structure](docs/mdtm-directory-structure.md), allowing you to organize tasks in feature-specific subdirectories:

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from NPM

#### Global Installation

```bash
# Install globally with npm
npm install -g @scopecraft/cmd

# Or with yarn
yarn global add @scopecraft/cmd

# Or with bun
bun install -g @scopecraft/cmd
```

After global installation, the following commands will be available anywhere on your system:

- `scopecraft` / `sc` - CLI for task management
- `scopecraft-mcp` / `sc-mcp` - MCP server (HTTP/SSE with SDK implementation)
- `scopecraft-stdio` / `sc-stdio` - MCP server with STDIO transport

#### Using with npx (No Installation Required)

You can run the commands directly without installation using npx:

```bash
# Run the CLI
npx @scopecraft/cmd list
npx @scopecraft/cmd create --title "New Task" --type "ðŸŒŸ Feature"

# Run the MCP server (using the -p flag to specify the package, then the binary name)
npx -p @scopecraft/cmd scopecraft-mcp
# Or with the shorter alias
npx -p @scopecraft/cmd sc-mcp

# Run the MCP server with STDIO transport
npx -p @scopecraft/cmd scopecraft-stdio
# Or with the shorter alias
npx -p @scopecraft/cmd sc-stdio
```

Note: When using npx with additional binaries from the package, you need to use the `-p` flag to specify the package name, then provide the binary name to execute.

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/scopecraft/command.git
cd command

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build

# Link for development (creates scopecraft/sc and scopecraft-mcp/sc-mcp commands)
bun link
```

### Local Distribution Testing

The project includes a streamlined workflow for testing the distributable package locally without publishing to npm. This is particularly useful for verifying integration with MCP clients like Claude Code.

```bash
# After committing changes to main, build and package the project:
npm run publish:local      # Creates tarball in ~/MCP/scopecraft/

# Install the package globally:
npm run install:local      # Installs globally and verifies CLI commands

# Verify installation:
sc --version               # Should display current version
sc-mcp --version           # Should match version in package.json
sc-stdio --version         # Should match version in package.json
```

**Note for Claude Code users:** After running these commands, Claude Code will automatically detect the `scopecraft-cmd` MCP server, and tools will be available with the prefix `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list`.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the MCP tools aren't detected, check ~/.claude.json for proper configuration
- If CLI commands aren't found, verify that npm's global bin directory is in your PATH

## CLI Usage

The CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing tasks:

```bash
# Basic commands
sc list                   # Short alias
scopecraft list           # Full command
sc get TASK-ID
sc create --title "New task" --type "ðŸŒŸ Feature"
sc update TASK-ID --status "ðŸ”µ In Progress"
sc delete TASK-ID

# Status shortcuts
sc start TASK-ID     # Mark as In Progress
sc complete TASK-ID  # Mark as Done
sc block TASK-ID     # Mark as Blocked
sc review TASK-ID    # Mark as In Review
```

### Task Relationships

```bash
# Create a task with relationships
sc create \
  --title "Task with Relationships" \
  --type "ðŸŒŸ Feature" \
  --phase "phase-1" \
  --parent "PARENT-TASK-ID" \
  --depends "DEPENDENCY-TASK-ID" \
  --previous "PREVIOUS-TASK-ID" \
  --next "NEXT-TASK-ID"
```

### MDTM Directory Structure

For detailed documentation, see [MDTM Directory Structure Support](docs/mdtm-directory-structure.md).

```bash
# Create a feature overview file
sc create \
  --id "_overview" \
  --title "Authentication Feature" \
  --type "ðŸŒŸ Feature" \
  --phase "release-v1" \
  --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"

# Create a task within a feature subdirectory
sc create \
  --title "Login Form UI" \
  --type "ðŸŒŸ Feature" \
  --phase "release-v1" \
  --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"

# List tasks in a specific subdirectory
sc list --phase "release-v1" --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"

# List only overview files across all phases
sc list --overview

# Move a task to a different subdirectory
sc update TASK-ID --subdirectory "FEATURE_UserProfiles"
```

### Workflow Navigation

```bash
# Show tasks currently in progress
sc current-task

# Find the next task to work on
sc next-task

# Find the next task after completing a specific task
sc next-task TASK-ID

# Mark a task complete and show the next task
sc mark-complete-next TASK-ID
```

### Phase Management

```bash
# List all phases
sc phases

# Create a new phase
sc phase-create --id "phase-1" --name "Planning Phase" --description "Initial planning stage"

# Update a phase
sc phase-update phase-1 --name "Updated Phase Name" --description "New description" --status "ðŸ”µ In Progress"

# Change phase ID (rename)
sc phase-update phase-1 --new-id "planning-phase"

# Delete a phase
sc phase-delete phase-1
# Force delete a phase with tasks
sc phase-delete phase-1 --force

# Phase status shortcuts
sc phase-start phase-1      # Mark as In Progress
sc phase-complete phase-1   # Mark as Completed
sc phase-block phase-1      # Mark as Blocked
sc phase-pending phase-1    # Mark as Pending
```

## MCP Server Usage

The MCP server provides an API that can be used by Roo Commander's LLM agents using the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
# Start the MCP server on the default port (3500)
sc-mcp                      # Short alias
scopecraft-mcp              # Full command

# Start on a custom port
sc-mcp --port 3501

# Start with the STDIO transport (useful for terminal-based operation)
sc-mcp-stdio
```

> **New:** The MCP server now uses the official MCP SDK with both StreamableHTTP and STDIO transport options. See [MCP SDK documentation](docs/mcp-sdk.md) for details.

}
```

## Development

### Running in Dev Mode

```bash
# Run CLI in dev mode
bun run dev:cli -- list

# Run MCP server in dev mode
bun run dev:mcp
```

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses Biome for linting and formatting, and TypeScript for type checking.

```bash
# Run quality checks (auto-detects staged/changed files)
bun run code-check

# Check all files
bun run code-check --all

# Check specific files
bun run code-check --staged   # Only staged files
bun run code-check --changed  # Only changed files

# Individual tools
bun run typecheck               # TypeScript only
bun run check                   # Biome only

# Lint the code with Biome
bun run lint

# Check code formatting with Biome
bun run format

# Format code with Biome (applies changes)
bun run format:fix

# Check (lint + format) the code with Biome
bun run check

# Run all checks and tests (CI workflow)
bun run ci
```

### Entity-Command Pattern

The CLI follows an intuitive entity-command pattern, where commands are organized by entity type followed by operation. This structure makes the commands more predictable and easier to discover.

```
<entity> <command> [options]
```

Entity types include:
- `task` - Task management operations
- `phase` - Phase management operations
- `feature` - Feature directory operations (FEATURE_* directories)
- `area` - Area directory operations (AREA_* directories)
- `workflow` - Task workflow and sequence operations
- `template` - Template management operations

Backward compatibility with legacy command format is maintained, so both formats work:

```bash
# New entity-command format
sc task list                         # List tasks
sc phase create --id "phase-1" ...   # Create a phase

# Legacy format (still supported)
sc list                              # List tasks
sc phase-create --id "phase-1" ...   # Create a phase
```

## Integration Options

This project is designed to be versatile and can be used in different ways:

### Standalone Usage

You can use Scopecraft Command directly to manage MDTM task files in any project, whether or not you're using Roo Commander. The tool supports the standardized MDTM format with either TOML or YAML frontmatter.

### Integration with Roo Commander

Scopecraft Command complements Roo Commander's LLM-based task management by providing direct CRUD operations on task files. The MCP server allows Roo Commander's LLM agents to interact with tasks efficiently without having to generate and parse markdown themselves.

#### MCP Server Configuration in Roo Commander

To integrate with Roo Commander, you'll need to configure the MCP server in your Roo Commander settings. Please refer to the Roo Commander documentation for details on how to register and use an MCP server.

### Project Type Detection

The tool automatically detects whether it's being used in a Roo Commander project or a standalone project and adapts its behavior accordingly. This enables seamless operation in different environments without requiring special configuration.

## Credits and Attribution

Scopecraft Command implements the Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) format, which was originally created and documented by the [Roo Commander](https://github.com/jezweb/roo-commander) project. We are grateful to the creators of Roo Commander for developing this standardized format for task management in markdown files with TOML/YAML frontmatter.

This project aims to be fully compatible with the MDTM format while providing additional tooling that can be used standalone or alongside Roo Commander.
