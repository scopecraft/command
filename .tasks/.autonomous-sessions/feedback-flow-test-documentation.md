# Feedback Flow Test Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the feedback flow mechanism in the autonomous task execution system.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **implement-auto** - Main script for autonomous execution
   - Location: `/Users/davidpaquet/Projects/roo-task-cli/implement-auto`
   - Implementation: `scripts/implement-autonomous.ts`

2. **Session Management**
   - Sessions stored in `.tasks/.autonomous-sessions/`
   - Session info files: `task-{taskId}-{timestamp}.info.json`
   - Log files in `.tasks/.autonomous-sessions/logs/`

3. **Monitoring**
   - Web UI at `/autonomous` route
   - No CLI monitor command (monitor-auto referenced but doesn't exist)
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

## Feedback Flow Process

### 1. Initial Execution
```bash
./implement-auto <taskId> [parentId]
```
- Creates session with unique name: `task-{taskId}-{timestamp}`
- Saves session info JSON with status "running"
- Launches detached channelcoder process
- Logs output to session log file

### 2. Decision Point
When the autonomous task needs feedback:
- Task updates its markdown file with questions in Tasks section
- Questions follow format:
  ```markdown
  ### Questions/Feedback Needed
  - [ ] **[human]** Which approach to use?
    - Context: [explanation]
    - Options: A, B, C
    - Assumption: [default choice]
    - Impact: [consequences]
    - Priority: High/Medium/Low
  ```
- Task can continue with assumptions or pause

### 3. Continuation with Feedback
```bash
./implement-auto --continue <taskId> "Your feedback message"
```
- Loads most recent session for the task
- Creates new log file for continuation
- Passes feedback to resumed session
- Task processes feedback and continues

### 4. Session States
- **running** - Active execution
- **waiting_feedback** - Paused for input (not implemented in current code)
- **completed** - Finished or inactive >2 minutes
- **error** - Failed execution

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Feedback Test
1. Create task requiring decision
2. Execute autonomously
3. Task documents question and continues with assumption
4. Human provides feedback via continue command
5. Task adjusts based on feedback

### Scenario 2: Multiple Decision Points
1. Task encounters first decision
2. Documents and continues
3. Encounters second decision
4. Human provides batch feedback
5. Task processes all feedback

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
1. Task fails during execution
2. Session marked as error
3. Continue command loads state
4. Task recovers from error point

## Implementation Details

### Session Info Structure
```json
{
  "sessionName": "task-{taskId}-{timestamp}",
  "taskId": "task-id",
  "parentId": "optional-parent-id",
  "logFile": "/absolute/path/to/log",
  "startTime": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "status": "running|completed|error",
  "pid": 12345
}
```

### Log File Format
- Uses channelcoder event stream format
- Contains assistant messages, tool uses, results
- Parsed by streamParser for display

### UI Integration
- `/api/autonomous-sessions` - List all sessions
- `/api/autonomous-sessions/{taskId}` - Get session details
- `/api/autonomous-sessions/logs` - Get combined logs
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Testing Results

### Findings
1. **Session Creation**: Works correctly, creates proper file structure
2. **Log Monitoring**: UI successfully parses and displays logs
3. **Continuation**: Mechanism exists but "waiting_feedback" state not implemented
4. **State Persistence**: Sessions persist between executions
5. **Error Recovery**: Basic support via session reload

### Issues Discovered
1. No explicit "waiting_feedback" status in code
2. monitor-auto command referenced but doesn't exist
3. Path handling inconsistency (absolute vs relative) in handlers
4. No automatic status transition to waiting_feedback

### Recommendations
1. Implement explicit waiting_feedback status
2. Create monitor-auto CLI command or update docs
3. Standardize path handling in session files
4. Add feedback request detection in log parsing
5. Implement proper state machine for session status

## Example Test Execution

### Create Test Task
```bash
bun run dev:cli task create --title "Test feedback flow" --type test
```

### Execute Autonomously
```bash
./implement-auto test-feedback-flow-05A
```

### Monitor via UI
Navigate to: http://localhost:5174/autonomous

### Provide Feedback
```bash
./implement-auto --continue test-feedback-flow-05A "Use Option B with caching"
```

### Verify Results
- Check task markdown file for updates
- Review session logs
- Confirm UI shows correct status

## Conclusion

The feedback flow system provides a functional mechanism for autonomous tasks to request and receive human input during execution. While the core infrastructure is in place, several enhancements would improve the user experience, particularly around explicit feedback states and CLI monitoring tools.
