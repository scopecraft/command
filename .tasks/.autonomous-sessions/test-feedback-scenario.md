# Test Feedback Flow Scenario

## Phase 1: Initial Execution
The autonomous task starts and performs initial operations, then encounters a decision point.

## Decision Point
At this point, the task needs feedback on:
1. Which implementation approach to use (Option A or Option B)
2. Whether to include backward compatibility

## Phase 2: Continuation with Feedback
After receiving feedback, the task continues with the chosen approach.

## Expected Flow:
1. Task starts via `implement-auto test-feedback-flow-05A`
2. Task performs initial work
3. Task adds questions to the Tasks section
4. Task pauses (or continues with assumptions)
5. Human provides feedback via `implement-auto --continue test-feedback-flow-05A "Use Option B with compatibility"`
6. Task resumes and completes work based on feedback
