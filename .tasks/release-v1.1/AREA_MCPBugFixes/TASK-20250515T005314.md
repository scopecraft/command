## Description

Implement a comprehensive logging system for the MCP server using OpenTelemetry (OTEL) to improve observability, diagnostics, and error tracking. The current system has limited logging capabilities, which makes it difficult to diagnose issues like error propagation and MCP-specific failures.

## Objectives

1. Create a standardized logging infrastructure using OpenTelemetry
2. Implement configurable verbosity levels for different environments
3. Support multiple logging destinations (console, file, external services)
4. Capture detailed context with each log event
5. Integrate with error handling to provide comprehensive error diagnostics

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

- Add OpenTelemetry dependencies to the project
- Create a centralized logger service that all modules can use
- Implement structured logging with context support
- Add configuration options for verbosity and destinations
- Create middleware/interceptors to automatically log requests and responses

### Logging Levels

- ERROR: Critical failures requiring immediate attention
- WARN: Issues that don't cause failures but indicate problems
- INFO: Important application events (startup, shutdown, etc.)
- DEBUG: Detailed information useful for debugging (only shown in verbose mode)
- TRACE: Highly detailed diagnostic information (SDK interactions, full payloads)

### Context Information

For each log event, capture relevant context:
- Request ID (for correlation)
- Method name
- Client information
- Performance metrics (timing)
- Related resource identifiers

### MCP SDK Integration

- Add OTEL instrumentation to communicate with the MCP SDK
- Create spans around MCP operations for distributed tracing
- Capture all error cases with full context
- Automatically trace error propagation paths

## Key Features

1. **Configurable Verbosity**:
   - Quiet mode (errors only)
   - Normal mode (errors + warnings + important info)
   - Verbose mode (all except trace)
   - Debug mode (everything)

2. **Multiple Destinations**:
   - Console output with color coding
   - File logging with rotation
   - Support for external collectors (when needed)

3. **Structured Output Formats**:
   - Human-readable format for development
   - JSON format for machine processing
   - OTEL protocol format for collectors

4. **Error Enhanced Logging**:
   - Automatic stack trace capture
   - Error categorization
   - Related request/response capture
   - Correlation of related errors

## Implementation Phases

1. **Setup and Basic Implementation**:
   - Add OTEL dependencies
   - Create logger interface and service
   - Implement basic logging levels
   - Add configuration options

2. **MCP Server Integration**:
   - Update HTTP server to use logger
   - Add middleware for request/response logging
   - Integrate with error handling

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Add distributed tracing
   - Create dashboard for log visualization
   - Implement advanced filtering

## Benefits

- Improved ability to diagnose error conditions
- Better visibility into MCP operations
- Easier debugging of complex integration issues
- Standardized approach to logging across components
- Enhanced error reporting capabilities

## Relation to Other Tasks

This task directly supports the error handling improvements in TASK-MCP-ERROR-HANDLING, providing the infrastructure needed to better diagnose and trace error propagation issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Logging is implemented using OpenTelemetry standards
- All MCP server components use the centralized logger
- Verbosity level is configurable via CLI options
- Error events capture full context including stack traces
- Logs include sufficient context to trace request flow
- Performance impact is minimal in production mode
- Documentation is updated to describe logging system
