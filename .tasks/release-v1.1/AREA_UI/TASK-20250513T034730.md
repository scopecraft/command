# Fix Markdown typography styling not applying in task content

The Markdown content in task descriptions is correctly transformed into HTML elements with appropriate tags (h2, p, etc.) and prose classes are added, but the Tailwind Typography styling is not being visually applied. This results in plain unstyled markdown content in the task detail view.

## Current Behavior

When viewing a task's details:
- The Markdown content is parsed correctly
- HTML tags are generated properly (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
- The `prose` CSS classes from Tailwind Typography plugin are added
- However, the actual styling (fonts, spacing, colors, etc.) is not visually applied

## Expected Behavior

Markdown content should be properly styled with the Tailwind Typography plugin, including:
- Proper spacing between elements
- Appropriate font sizes and weights for headings
- Styled lists (bullets, numbering)
- Block quotes
- Code blocks
- Links
- All other Markdown elements with proper typography

## Technical Analysis

The issue appears to be in the CSS specificity or inheritance. While the prose classes are correctly added in `TaskContent.tsx`:

```tsx
<div className="prose prose-sm dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
  <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]} rehypePlugins={[rehypeRaw]}>
    {task.content || ''}
  </ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```

The styles are not being applied. The possible causes include:

1. CSS specificity issues where other styles override the typography styles
2. The Typography plugin might not be properly loaded during build
3. Potential CSS inheritance issues in parent containers
4. Dark mode configuration might be interfering with the styles

## Implementation Notes

A temporary fix has been attempted by adding more specific typography classes, but a more comprehensive solution is needed:

```tsx
<div className="prose prose-sm dark:prose-invert max-w-none prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:text-foreground prose-p:text-base prose-p:text-foreground prose-a:text-primary prose-strong:text-foreground prose-strong:font-bold prose-code:bg-muted prose-code:p-1 prose-code:rounded prose-code:text-foreground prose-code:font-mono prose-code:text-sm prose-pre:bg-muted prose-pre:text-foreground prose-pre:font-mono prose-pre:text-sm prose-pre:p-2 prose-pre:rounded-md prose-ol:text-foreground prose-ul:text-foreground">
  <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]} rehypePlugins={[rehypeRaw]}>
    {task.content || ''}
  </ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```

However, this approach is verbose and may not address all typography elements.

## Steps to Fix

1. Verify that `@tailwindcss/typography` is properly configured in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Inspect CSS inheritance and specificity issues in the task content container
3. Check for conflicts with the current color theme and dark mode
4. Ensure the typography styles are being properly built and included in the CSS output
5. Consider creating a dedicated styled component for markdown content

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Markdown content is properly styled with Tailwind Typography
- [ ] All markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, etc.) have appropriate styling
- [ ] Typography styling works correctly in both light and dark modes
- [ ] The solution is maintainable and doesn't rely on excessive inline styling
