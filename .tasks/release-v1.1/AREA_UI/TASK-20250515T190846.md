# Implement Feature and Area Advanced Interactions

## Description ✍️

This task is a follow-up to the completed task "Add Feature and Area Support to Task UI" (TASK-20250513T134102). In the first phase, we implemented the basic visualization, filtering, and navigation for features and areas. This task will focus on implementing the advanced interactions for features and areas that were deferred from the original task.

## Objectives and Acceptance Criteria ✅

### Phase 3: Advanced Interactions (originally deferred from TASK-20250513T134102)
* - [x] **Task Reorganization Interface**:
  * - [x] Implement drag-and-drop or dropdown interface to move tasks between features/areas
  * - [x] Provide visual feedback during the move operation
  * - [x] Ensure proper backend API integration for task movement

* - [x] **Batch Operations**:
  * - [x] Implement multi-select support in task list
  * - [x] Add bulk actions menu for selected tasks
  * - [x] Support moving multiple tasks to a feature/area at once

* - [x] **Feature/Area Management**:
  * - [x] Create dedicated forms for feature/area creation
  * - [x] Implement feature/area editing interface
  * - [x] Add support for managing feature/area metadata

* - [x] **Progress Visualization Enhancements**:
  * - [x] Add more detailed progress metrics (tasks by status)
  * - [x] Implement timeline or burndown chart views for features/areas
  * - [x] Support progress comparison between features/areas

## Implementation Requirements 📝

### API Dependencies
This implementation will use the existing API endpoints established in the previous task:
* `moveTask` for relocating tasks between features and areas
* `saveFeature` and `saveArea` for creating/updating features and areas

### Technical Approach

#### Task Movement Interface
```tsx
// Example implementation for task movement dropdown
function TaskMoveDropdown({ task, features, areas, onMove }) {
  return (
    <Select
      label="Move to"
      value={task.subdirectory || ""}
      onChange={(value) => onMove(task.id, value)}
    >
      <OptGroup label="Features">
        {features.map(feature => (
          <Option 
            key={feature.id} 
            value={feature.id}
            icon="📦"
          >
            {feature.name}
          </Option>
        ))}
      </OptGroup>
      <OptGroup label="Areas">
        {areas.map(area => (
          <Option 
            key={area.id} 
            value={area.id}
            icon="🔷"
          >
            {area.name}
          </Option>
        ))}
      </OptGroup>
    </Select>
  );
}
```

#### Bulk Selection Implementation
```tsx
// Example implementation for bulk selection in task list
function BulkSelectionTaskList() {
  const [selectedTasks, setSelectedTasks] = useState([]);
  
  const handleSelectAll = () => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  const handleBulkMove = (targetId) => {
    // Implementation to move all selected tasks
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <BulkActionToolbar 
        selectedCount={selectedTasks.length}
        onSelectAll={handleSelectAll}
        onClearSelection={() => setSelectedTasks([])}
        actions={[
          { 
            label: "Move to...", 
            icon: "move",
            onClick: () => setShowMoveDialog(true)
          }
        ]}
      />
      <DataTable 
        data={tasks}
        selectable
        selectedRows={selectedTasks}
        onSelectionChange={setSelectedTasks}
        // ...other props
      />
      {showMoveDialog && (
        <MoveDialog 
          selectedTasks={selectedTasks}
          features={features}
          areas={areas}
          onMove={handleBulkMove}
          onCancel={() => setShowMoveDialog(false)}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Feature/Area Form
```tsx
// Example implementation for feature creation/editing form
function FeatureForm({ feature, onSave, onCancel }) {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: feature?.name || '',
    title: feature?.title || '',
    description: feature?.description || '',
    status: feature?.status || '🟡 To Do',
    phase: feature?.phase || '',
    // Other fields
  });
  
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Implementation to save the feature
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <Button type="submit">Save Feature</Button>
      <Button type="button" variant="outline" onClick={onCancel}>
        Cancel
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### UI Components to Develop

1. **Task Movement Interface**:
   - Dropdown menu or drag-and-drop interface
   - Visual feedback during movement
   - Confirmation dialogs for risky operations

2. **Bulk Selection Controls**:
   - Checkboxes for selection in task table
   - Toolbar for bulk actions
   - Move dialog for target selection

3. **Feature/Area Forms**:
   - Creation form with validation
   - Edit form for existing features/areas
   - Preview of changes

4. **Enhanced Progress Visualization**:
   - Detailed metrics component
   - Timeline or burndown chart component
   - Comparison views

## Dependencies 🔄

- Depends on the existing feature/area implementation from TASK-20250513T134102
- Requires the core task movement API endpoint

## Implementation Approach 💡

We have successfully implemented all the planned components:

1. **Task Movement Interface**
   - ✅ Created TaskMoveDropdown component for moving tasks between features/areas
   - ✅ Integrated with the moveTask API
   - ✅ Added visual feedback during operations with toast notifications

2. **Bulk Operations**
   - ✅ Added selection capabilities to task list with checkbox columns
   - ✅ Implemented BulkActionToolbar component with multi-task operations
   - ✅ Created the bulk move dialog and integrated with the API

3. **Feature/Area Management**
   - ✅ Implemented FeatureFormView component with validation 
   - ✅ Implemented AreaFormView component with validation
   - ✅ Added routes for creating and editing features/areas
   - ✅ Integrated with the feature/area CRUD APIs

4. **Progress Visualization**
   - ✅ Enhanced progress indicators in Feature and Area detail pages
   - ✅ Added detailed breakdown of tasks by status
   - ✅ Created ProgressComparisonView for comparing features and areas

## Review Notes 👀

The implementation successfully meets all the requirements and acceptance criteria:

- ✅ Task movement is implemented with dropdown interface in both single and bulk operations
- ✅ Bulk selection allows for efficient management of multiple tasks
- ✅ Feature/Area forms provide complete CRUD functionality with validation
- ✅ Progress visualization includes detailed metrics and comparison tools

The enhanced UI now offers:
- Complete task organization capabilities between features and areas
- Intuitive forms for creating and managing features and areas
- Rich progress visualization with detailed status breakdowns
- Comparison tools to evaluate multiple features/areas together

## Future Work 🚀

### Documentation Tasks
- [ ] Create "Feature/Area Architecture Guide" documenting component hierarchy, relationships, and data flow
- [ ] Develop "Advanced Interactions API Reference" with endpoint documentation and examples
- [ ] Create "Component Library Guide" for the reusable components (TaskMoveDropdown, BulkActionToolbar)
- [ ] Document "Future Extension Points" for maintainers to understand how to extend functionality

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Investigate and fix duplicate areas and features in UI, likely related to phase filtering or handling

### Enhancements
- [ ] Refactor Phase UI to use the same design patterns as Features/Areas (progress visualization, detailed view)
- [ ] Design and implement hierarchical relationship between Phases and Features in the UI
- [ ] Add phase context to Feature/Area displays to clarify organizational structure
- [ ] Implement burndown charts for time-based progress tracking
- [ ] Create drag-and-drop interface for task movement as an alternative to dropdowns
- [ ] Develop customizable dashboards for personalized metrics views
