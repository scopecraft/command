# Feature Proposal: Command Orchestration Integration

## Problem Statement
Currently, users must manually provide context when launching Claude Code commands, making it difficult to leverage the full power of specialized commands in different contexts. Users working on features, tasks, or areas have to repeatedly specify relevant IDs or context, leading to friction in the development workflow.

## Proposed Solution
Add command orchestration capabilities to all clients (CLI, MCP, Task UI) that allow users to list available Claude Code commands and launch them with pre-filled context. When viewing an entity (feature, task, area), users can select a command to run with that entity's context automatically provided.

## Key Benefits
- Seamless workflow integration between task management and development commands
- Reduced manual work in providing context to commands
- Improved discoverability of available commands
- Faster development cycles by eliminating context-switching friction

## Scope

### Included
- Command listing capability in all clients
- Command launching with context from current entity
- Support for interactive and non-interactive commands
- Basic command metadata (name, description)

### Not Included
- Command creation/editing through the UI
- Command parameter validation
- Command history tracking
- Complex multi-entity context passing

## Technical Approach
Implement a command discovery system that reads available commands from `.claude/commands/` directory. Add UI elements in the Task UI, MCP methods for command interaction, and CLI subcommands for listing and launching commands. Each client will detect the current context (which task/feature/area is being viewed) and pass it as pre-filled arguments.

## Implementation Estimate
2-3 weeks for full implementation across all clients:
- 1 week for core command discovery and launching logic
- 1 week for UI implementation and client integration
- 0.5 week for testing and documentation

## Dependencies & Risks
- Claude Code command structure changes could affect discovery mechanism
- UI real estate considerations for command integration
- Need to handle edge cases where commands require specific argument formats
- Potential performance impact when reading many command files

## Open Questions
- Should we cache command metadata for performance?
- How to handle commands that require multiple arguments?
- Should we support command filtering by type/category?
- Best UX pattern for command selection in the UI

### Human Review Required
Flag decisions needing verification:
- [ ] Scope decisions made without explicit requirements
- [ ] UI integration approach assumptions
- [ ] Command discovery mechanism design
- [ ] Performance optimization requirements
- [ ] Effort estimates based on limited analysis
