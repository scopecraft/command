# Worktree Dashboard for Tasks UI

## Overview

The Worktree Dashboard will transform the Tasks UI home screen into a centralized monitoring interface for active git worktrees. This feature addresses the challenge of managing multiple parallel tasks by providing a card-based view with critical information about each worktree, including task metadata, git status, and activity timestamps. This enables users to efficiently monitor and switch between parallel workspaces without excessive context switching.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Worktree Discovery**
   - 1.1. Detect and list all active git worktrees for the current repository
   - 1.2. Extract branch names and match them to corresponding task IDs
   - 1.3. Handle edge cases where worktree branches don't match task ID pattern
   - 1.4. Auto-refresh worktree list at configurable intervals (default: 30 seconds)

2. **Worktree Information Display**
   - 2.1. Display each worktree as a card in a responsive grid layout
   - 2.2. Show task ID, title, and status from task metadata
   - 2.3. Show git branch name and current commit hash
   - 2.4. Display count of uncommitted changes, if any
   - 2.5. Show most recent commit message and timestamp
   - 2.6. Indicate last activity timestamp for the worktree

3. **Status Visualization**
   - 3.1. Use color coding to indicate worktree status (active, clean, has changes)
   - 3.2. Provide visual emphasis for worktrees with uncommitted changes
   - 3.3. Include placeholder for future Claude interaction status
   - 3.4. Implement a status indicator for each worktree (indicator icon + label)

4. **Interaction**
   - 4.1. Enable clicking a worktree card to view detailed information
   - 4.2. Provide direct links to open the task in the task detail view
   - 4.3. Allow manual refresh of worktree status
   - 4.4. Include configuration options for refresh interval

### Technical Requirements

1. **Git Integration**
   - 1.1. Use simplegit package for git operations
   - 1.2. Create backend API endpoints to safely execute git commands
   - 1.3. Implement caching to prevent excessive git operations
   - 1.4. Handle git errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

2. **Task System Integration**
   - 2.1. Fetch task metadata for corresponding worktree branches
   - 2.2. Use existing task API endpoints for metadata retrieval
   - 2.3. Handle cases where tasks may have been deleted or moved

3. **Performance & Scalability**
   - 3.1. Optimize for up to 10 concurrent worktrees
   - 3.2. Implement pagination if more than 10 worktrees exist
   - 3.3. Use efficient polling strategies to minimize resource usage
   - 3.4. Implement proper loading and error states

4. **Extensibility**
   - 4.1. Design component architecture to accommodate future enhancements
   - 4.2. Include hooks for future Claude interaction monitoring
   - 4.3. Support future feature grouping of related worktrees

## UI/UX Design

### Dashboard Layout

1. The dashboard will replace the current home view in the Tasks UI
2. A responsive grid layout will display worktree cards (3 columns on large screens, 2 on medium, 1 on small)
3. Each card will be approximately 320px wide and 200px tall
4. A top bar will include:
   - Dashboard title ("Worktree Dashboard")
   - Last refresh timestamp
   - Manual refresh button
   - Settings button for configuration options

### Worktree Card Design

1. Each card will include:
   - Header: Task ID and status indicator (color-coded)
   - Title: Task title (truncated if necessary)
   - Status section: Git status (clean/changes) with icon and count
   - Activity section: Last commit info and timestamp
   - Footer: Links to task detail and refresh button

2. Status indicators:
   - Green: Clean worktree (no uncommitted changes)
   - Yellow: Uncommitted changes present
   - Gray: Inactive/stale worktree (no recent activity)
   - Blue: Active worktree (recent activity)

3. Card interactions:
   - Hover: Subtle elevation change
   - Click: Open detailed view or expand card
   - Status icons: Show tooltips with additional information

### User Flow

1. User opens Tasks UI
2. Dashboard automatically loads and displays active worktrees
3. User can scan cards to quickly assess the status of all worktrees
4. User clicks on a specific card to see more details or follow task link
5. Dashboard automatically refreshes at the configured interval
6. User can manually refresh or configure settings as needed

## Technical Design

   - Handles worktree discovery and status checks
   - Implements caching and polling strategies

4. **WorktreeDetailView** (new component)
   - Expanded view of a single worktree
   - Shows detailed git status and history
   - Provides quick actions for worktree management

### API Endpoints

1. **GET /api/worktrees**
   - Returns list of all worktrees with basic information
   - Parameters: None
   - Response: Array of worktree objects

2. **GET /api/worktrees/:worktreedId**
   - Returns detailed information for a specific worktree
   - Parameters: worktreeId (path or branch name)
   - Response: Detailed worktree object

3. **GET /api/worktrees/:worktreeId/status**
   - Returns git status for specific worktree
   - Parameters: worktreeId
   - Response: Git status object (changes, commits, etc.)

### Data Models

```typescript
// Worktree model
interface Worktree {
  id: string;            // Unique identifier (path hash or branch name)
  path: string;          // Filesystem path to worktree
  branch: string;        // Git branch name
  taskId?: string;       // Associated task ID (if available)
  lastActivity: Date;    // Timestamp of last activity
  status: WorktreeStatus; // Current status information
}

// Worktree status model
interface WorktreeStatus {
  isClean: boolean;      // No uncommitted changes
  changesCount: number;  // Number of uncommitted changes
  lastCommit?: {         // Information about last commit
    hash: string;        // Commit hash
    message: string;     // Commit message
    author: string;      // Author name
    timestamp: Date;     // Commit timestamp
  };
  isActive: boolean;     // Recent activity detected
}

// Dashboard configuration
interface WorktreeDashboardConfig {
  refreshInterval: number; // Auto-refresh interval in seconds
  maxWorktrees: number;   // Maximum worktrees to display per page
  showInactive: boolean;  // Whether to show inactive worktrees
}
```
