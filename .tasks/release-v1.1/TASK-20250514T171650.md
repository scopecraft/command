# Cross-Entity Search and Relationship Queries

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** Unified search across different entity types with relationship queries
* **Why is it needed?** Currently need to search phases, features, and tasks separately
* **Scope:** Add unified search command with cross-entity capabilities and relationship traversal
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Implement unified search command that searches across all entity types
* - [ ] Support text search across content and metadata
* - [ ] Add relationship traversal in queries (find tasks related to X)
* - [ ] Implement relevance scoring and sorting
* - [ ] Support entity-specific search refinement
* - [ ] Update documentation with search query examples

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design search query schema
* - [ ] Implement search index or efficient search algorithm
* - [ ] Create relationship graph traversal logic
* - [ ] Add relevance scoring mechanism
* - [ ] Implement search result formatter
* - [ ] Create tests for complex search scenarios

## Current Behavior

Need to search phases, features, and tasks separately with limited search capabilities.

## Proposed Behavior

Add a unified search command that searches across all entity types:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__search": {
  "query": "dashboard",
  "include_phases": true,
  "include_features": true,
  "include_tasks": true
}
```

With additional capabilities for relationship queries:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__search": {
  "query": "related_to:TASK-123 AND status:pending"
}
```

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Efficient search algorithm for different entity types
* Relationship graph construction and traversal
* Query language design for complex searches
* Performance optimization for large projects
* Relevance scoring mechanism
