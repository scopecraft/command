# Template-Specific MCP Tools Generator

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** A system that dynamically generates template-specific MCP tools with structured parameters based on task templates
* **Why is it needed?** Current workflow requires creating a basic task, then updating it to match template structure, which is inefficient and error-prone
* **Scope:** Create a parser for templates that generates corresponding MCP tools with structured parameters matching template sections
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Create a template parser that identifies sections and input fields
* - [ ] Implement a schema generator for MCP tools based on template structure
* - [ ] Add dynamic MCP method registration mechanism
* - [ ] Support all standard template types (feature, bug, documentation, etc.)
* - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing task_create method
* - [ ] Add documentation for template syntax conventions and usage

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Define template syntax conventions for marking input fields (e.g., {{field_name}})
* - [ ] Create parser for template files to extract field definitions
* - [ ] Build MCP tool schema generator that converts template structures to JSON schemas
* - [ ] Implement dynamic tool registration in MCP server
* - [ ] Add validation rules based on field requirements
* - [ ] Create tests for template parsing and tool generation
* - [ ] Update documentation with examples of template-based tool usage

## Current Behavior

Currently, to create a task with the proper template structure, users must:
1. Create a basic task with minimal metadata
2. Understand the template structure manually
3. Update the task with properly formatted content

This is especially cumbersome in MCP contexts where an AI assistant must perform multiple steps to create a properly formatted task.

## Proposed Behavior

With template-specific MCP tools:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_template_create": {
  "title": "Enhanced Task Listing",
  "phase": "release-v1",
  "priority": "🔼 High",
  "description": {
    "what": "Enhanced task listing in collection views",
    "why": "Current task listings show only IDs",
    "scope": "Modify phase_list and feature_list endpoints"
  },
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2"],
  "implementation_notes": ["Note 1", "Note 2"],
  "current_behavior": "Current behavior description",
  "proposed_behavior": "Proposed behavior description"
}
```

The MCP server would automatically format these inputs into the proper template structure, creating a well-formed task in a single operation.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Parse templates at server startup to generate tool schemas
* Create a parser that matches section headings (## Description) and identifies input fields
* Generate JSON schemas for each template dynamically
* Register MCP methods for each template type
* Support complex nested structures (arrays, objects) for different section types
* Ensure all template sections are optional except required metadata
