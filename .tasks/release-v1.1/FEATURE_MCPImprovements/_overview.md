# MCP Advanced Capabilities

## Description

This feature focuses on enhancing the MCP server capabilities with advanced functionality beyond the basic integration. The goal is to provide richer tools, better filtering, and more comprehensive task management through the MCP interface.

## Key Components

- Improved task listing with advanced filtering
- Comprehensive task details and relationship handling
- Tree view for hierarchical data visualization
- Bulk operations for efficient task management
- Cross-entity search and filtering

## Current Tasks

1. **Implement Enhanced Task Listing** (TASK-20250514T171534) - Add advanced filtering options
2. **Add Comprehensive Task Details** (TASK-20250514T171547) - Include relationships and history
3. **Create Tree View Functionality** (TASK-20250514T171557) - Hierarchical visualization
4. **Implement Relationship Handling** (TASK-20250514T171608) - Parent-child and dependency management
5. **Add Bulk Operations Support** (TASK-20250514T171621) - Mass updates and status changes
6. **Enhance Filtering Capabilities** (TASK-20250514T171638) - Named filters and combinations
7. **Implement Cross-Entity Search** (TASK-20250514T172639) - Search across tasks, features, and areas

## Success Criteria

- Advanced filtering works correctly in task listings
- Task details include complete relationship information
- Tree view provides intuitive hierarchical visualization
- Bulk operations efficiently manage multiple tasks
- Filtering supports complex queries and named filters
- Cross-entity search finds relevant content across different types
