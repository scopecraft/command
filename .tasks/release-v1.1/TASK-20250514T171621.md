# Bulk Task Operations

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** Bulk operations for creating, updating, or changing status of multiple tasks
* **Why is it needed?** Currently tasks need to be updated individually, which is inefficient for batch changes
* **Scope:** Add bulk_create, bulk_update, and related endpoints for efficient multi-task operations
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Implement task_bulk_update method for updating multiple tasks simultaneously
* - [ ] Add bulk operations for status changes (bulk_complete, bulk_start, etc.)
* - [ ] Create bulk_create capability for efficient task batch creation
* - [ ] Ensure atomicity (all operations succeed or none)
* - [ ] Add proper error handling and reporting for bulk operations
* - [ ] Update documentation with examples of bulk operations

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design bulk operation request/response schemas
* - [ ] Implement validation for bulk requests
* - [ ] Create transaction-like behavior for atomicity
* - [ ] Add options for different error handling strategies
* - [ ] Optimize performance for large batch operations
* - [ ] Create tests for bulk operations

## Current Behavior

Tasks need to be updated individually, requiring multiple API calls for batch operations.

## Proposed Behavior

Add bulk operations for creating, updating, or changing status of multiple tasks:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_bulk_update": {
  "task_ids": ["TASK-1", "TASK-2", "TASK-3"],
  "updates": {
    "metadata": {
      "status": "🟢 Completed"
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Batch validation to catch errors before processing
* Transaction-like semantics for atomicity
* Performance optimization for large batches
* Configurable error handling strategies
* Detailed reporting of operation results
