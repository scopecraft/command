## Description

Enhance the project root path detection by implementing support for the MCP Roots protocol. This will allow the MCP server to automatically detect and use project roots provided by MCP clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop, improving the integration experience for users.

## Background

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification includes a "Roots" concept that allows clients to inform servers about relevant resource locations. This feature builds on the basic CLI override implemented in the first phase, providing a more seamless integration with MCP-compatible tools.

## Dependencies

- Depends on [TASK-20250515T015612](TASK-20250515T015612.md) (Implement Basic CLI Override for Project Root Path)

## Implementation Details

1. Update the MCP server to:
   - Extract root information from MCP client connection data
   - Convert root URIs (e.g., `file:///path/to/project`) to filesystem paths
   - Prioritize roots provided by the client when determining the project location

2. Modify the core library to:
   - Accept root paths from the MCP server
   - Maintain a priority order for path detection:
     1. CLI override (`--root-dir`)
     2. MCP roots (when available)
     3. Current automatic detection (as fallback)

3. Handle edge cases:
   - Multiple roots provided by the client
   - Non-filesystem URIs
   - Invalid or inaccessible paths
   - Changes to roots during a session (if supported by the client)

## Technical Requirements

- Parse and validate MCP root URIs correctly
- Support the standard MCP Roots protocol format
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid roots
- Provide clear logging for debugging root detection issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server can extract root information from client connections
- [ ] Root URIs are correctly converted to filesystem paths
- [ ] The core library uses the correct priority order for path detection
- [ ] Multiple roots from a client are handled properly (using first valid root)
- [ ] Non-filesystem URIs are gracefully handled
- [ ] Invalid or inaccessible paths trigger appropriate error messages
- [ ] Documentation is updated to explain the MCP Roots integration
- [ ] Tests are added to verify the functionality

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for MCP root URI parsing and validation
- Integration tests with simulated MCP client connections
- Testing with actual MCP clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop)
- Edge case testing with various root configurations

## Documentation Updates Required

- Explain MCP Roots support in README and documentation
- Document the priority order for project path detection
- Add a troubleshooting section for root detection issues
- Include examples of how roots work with different MCP clients

## Future Considerations

This task builds on the basic CLI override and prepares for future multi-project support. The next enhancement will focus on:
- Tracking multiple project roots simultaneously
- Providing tools to list and switch between projects
- Supporting root change notifications during a session
