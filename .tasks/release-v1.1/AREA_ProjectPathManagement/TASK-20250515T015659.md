## Description

Extend the Project Path Management functionality to support working with multiple project roots simultaneously. This enhancement will provide users with tools to list available projects and switch between them during a session, allowing for a more flexible workflow when working across multiple codebases.

## Background

Building on the previous Project Path Management features (basic CLI override and MCP Roots integration), this task focuses on allowing users to work with multiple projects within a single MCP server session. This is particularly useful for users who need to access and modify code across different repositories during the same workflow.

## Implementation Details

1. Enhance the core library to:
   - Track multiple project roots simultaneously
   - Maintain context about which project is currently active
   - Support switching between projects without restarting the server

2. Create new MCP tools:
   - `project_list`: List all available project roots
   - `project_get`: Get details about the current active project
   - `project_set`: Switch the active project to a different root
   - `project_add`: Add a new project root during runtime

3. Update the MCP server to:
   - Accept multiple roots via CLI arguments (`--root-dirs path1,path2,path3`)
   - Store information about all available projects
   - Manage the active project context for request handling

4. Implement project selection strategies:
   - Default to the first project (configurable)
   - Remember the last active project for a session
   - Allow explicit selection via the project_set tool

## Technical Requirements

- Support for tracking multiple project roots and their properties
- Context management to maintain the active project state
- Clean API for switching between projects
- Consistent behavior across MCP tools when projects are switched
- Validation and security for all project paths

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core library supports tracking multiple project roots
- [ ] MCP server accepts multiple roots via CLI arguments
- [ ] New MCP tools are implemented: project_list, project_get, project_set, project_add
- [ ] Projects can be switched without restarting the server
- [ ] Context is maintained correctly when switching projects
- [ ] All MCP tools respect the currently active project
- [ ] Documentation explains multi-project workflow
- [ ] Tests verify all multi-project functionality

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for tracking multiple projects
- Integration tests for project switching
- End-to-end tests for MCP tools with multiple projects
- Edge case testing for project validation and selection

## Documentation Updates Required

- Explain multi-project support in README and documentation
- Document the new MCP tools with examples
- Create a guide for working with multiple projects
- Update CLI help text for new parameters
- Add examples for common multi-project workflows

## Future Considerations

This enhancement completes the Project Path Management area. Potential future improvements could include:
- Project-specific configuration options
- Persistent project settings between sessions
- Enhanced project metadata management
- Support for cross-project operations (copy/move between projects)
