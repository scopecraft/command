# Add Task Worktree Review Command

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

The task worktree functionality currently provides commands for starting work on a task (`tw-start`) and finishing a task (`tw-finish`), but lacks a dedicated code review mechanism. This task involves adding a new `tw-review` command that will leverage Claude Code to perform comprehensive code reviews of completed tasks, documenting the review findings both interactively and within the task file itself.

## Problem Analysis üîç

Currently, code reviews for tasks are:
1. Manual and inconsistent
2. Not automatically documented in the task file
3. Require repetitive tool authorization when using Claude for reviews
4. Not integrated into the task workflow

Adding a dedicated review command would:
- Standardize the review process
- Create a permanent record of reviews
- Streamline the workflow from development to completion
- Reduce repetitive authorization prompts
- Improve code quality through systematic reviews

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

- [ ] Create a new Claude slash command in `.claude/commands/task-review.md` for reviewing task implementations
- [ ] Add a `tw-review` command to the task worktree script
- [ ] Implement pre-authorization of necessary tools (linting, git commands, file access)
- [ ] Have the review results automatically appended to the task file
- [ ] Support both interactive review and documentation in a single workflow
- [ ] Add appropriate documentation for the new command

## Implementation Plan üìù

1. **Create Claude slash command**:
   - Create `.claude/commands/task-review.md` with a structured review prompt
   - Include instructions for code analysis, linting, test verification
   - Provide a template for the review output section

2. **Implement `tw-review` command**:
   - Add a new command to `task-worktree.ts`
   - Accept a task ID parameter (or infer from current directory)
   - Pre-authorize necessary tools using the `--allowedTools` flag

3. **Implement task file updating**:
   - Use MCP tools to append review results to the task markdown file
   - Add a structured "Implementation Review" section with timestamp

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Add information about the new command to README
   - Include examples of typical usage patterns

## Implementation Notes üí≠

### Claude Slash Command Structure

```markdown
# .claude/commands/task-review.md

I'm reviewing the implementation of task $ARGUMENTS.

Please perform a comprehensive review of the changes made for this task:

1. Analyze the git diff to understand what has changed
2. Run linting and type checking to ensure code quality
3. Verify that acceptance criteria have been met
4. Identify any potential issues, edge cases, or improvements
5. Check for adherence to project conventions and patterns

After your analysis, please:

1. Provide interactive feedback on any issues found
2. Prepare a structured review summary following this template:

## Implementation Review

**Review Date:** [current date]
**Reviewer:** Claude

### Code Quality
- Linting results: [pass/fail with details]
- Type checking: [pass/fail with details]
- Test coverage: [assessment]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [List each criterion and whether it's met]

### Issues
- [List any issues found]

### Suggestions
- [List any improvement suggestions]

### Conclusion
- [Overall assessment]
- [Recommendation: Approve/Request Changes]

Please update the task markdown file with this review section.
```

### `tw-review` Command Implementation

```typescript
program
  .command('review')
  .description('Review a task implementation')
  .argument('[taskId]', 'Optional task ID to review')
  .action(reviewWorktree);

async function reviewWorktree(taskId?: string) {
  // If no task ID provided, use current directory name as the task ID
  if (!taskId) {
    const currentDir = path.basename(process.cwd());
    if (fs.existsSync('.git') && fs.readFileSync('.git', 'utf8').trim().startsWith('gitdir:')) {
      taskId = currentDir;
      console.log(`Using current directory as task ID: ${taskId}`);
    } else {
      console.error('Error: Not in a task worktree directory. Please provide a task ID.');
      process.exit(1);
    }
  }
  
  // Get task details
  const taskResult = await getTask(taskId);
  if (!taskResult.success || !taskResult.data) {
    console.error(`Task ${taskId} not found.`);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  
  const task = taskResult.data;
  console.log(`Reviewing task: ${taskId} - ${task.title}`);
  
  // Check if we're in the worktree directory
  const worktreeDir = path.join(WORKTREES_DIR, taskId);
  let cwd = worktreeDir;
  
  if (!fs.existsSync(worktreeDir)) {
    console.log(`Worktree directory doesn't exist. Will review from main repository.`);
    cwd = process.cwd();
  }
  
  // Launch Claude with review command and pre-authorized tools
  console.log(`Launching Claude to review the task...`);
  
  const claudeProcess = Bun.spawn([
    'claude', 
    `/project:task-review ${taskId}`,
    '--allowedTools',
    'Bash(bun run lint)',
    'Bash(bun run typecheck)',
    'Bash(git diff:*)',
    'Edit',
    'Read',
    'Glob',
    'Grep',
    'LS'
  ], {
    stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit'],
    cwd: cwd,
  });
  
  // Wait for Claude process to complete
  await claudeProcess.exited;
  
  console.log(`Review of task ${taskId} completed.`);
}
```

## Test Plan üß™

- [ ] Test the `tw-review` command with a completed task
- [ ] Verify that pre-authorized tools work without prompts
- [ ] Check that the review section is properly added to the task file
- [ ] Test with various edge cases (missing task, non-existent worktree)
- [ ] Verify that linting and type checking results are accurately reported
- [ ] Test with both simple and complex code changes
