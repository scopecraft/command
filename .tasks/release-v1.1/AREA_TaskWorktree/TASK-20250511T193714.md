# Improve Task Worktree Directory Handling

## Description ✍️

When using the task worktree functionality, users are currently returned to the main repository directory after exiting the Claude Code session. This disrupts the workflow as users often want to continue working in the task worktree directory after receiving guidance or making changes with Claude. This task involves improving the directory handling in the `tw-start` command to allow users to remain in the task worktree directory after Claude exits.

## Problem Analysis 🔍

Currently, the `task-worktree.ts` script:
1. Creates a worktree directory
2. Changes to that directory using `process.chdir(worktreeDir)`
3. Launches Claude Code
4. When Claude exits, the user is returned to the original directory where they ran the `tw-start` command

This behavior occurs because:
- When a child process (Claude) is spawned from a Node.js/Bun script, the parent process continues running in its original working directory
- After the child process terminates, control returns to the parent process which is still in the original directory
- The directory change within the script only affects the script's execution environment, not the user's shell

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- [ ] Modify the `tw-start` command to prompt users about their preferred directory after Claude exits
- [ ] Provide a mechanism for users to remain in the task worktree directory if desired
- [ ] Implement a solution that works across different shells and operating systems
- [ ] Document the new behavior in the README and help text
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility for users who prefer the current behavior

## Implementation Plan 📝

1. **Add user prompt**:
   - After Claude exits, ask users if they want to switch to the task worktree directory
   - Accept y/n input to determine the next action

2. **Implement directory change mechanism**:
   - Output a special command marker that can be interpreted by a shell wrapper
   - The marker would include the path to the worktree directory
   - Format: `##DIRCHANGE##/path/to/worktree`

3. **Create shell wrapper function**:
   - Document a shell function that users can add to their shell configuration
   - The function would parse the output of the `tw-start` command
   - When it encounters the special marker, it would change the current directory

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Add instructions for setting up the shell wrapper in README
   - Explain the new behavior in the command help text
   - Provide examples of typical usage patterns

## Implementation Notes 💭

Example implementation of the shell wrapper function (for bash/zsh):

```bash
function tw-start() {
  bun run tw-start "$@" | while read line; do
    if [[ $line == \##DIRCHANGE##* ]]; then
      cd "${line#\##DIRCHANGE##}"
    else
      echo "$line"
    fi
  done
}
```

Example implementation for fish shell:

```fish
function tw-start
  bun run tw-start $argv | while read line
    if string match -q "##DIRCHANGE##*" $line
      cd (string replace "##DIRCHANGE##" "" $line)
    else
      echo $line
    end
  end
end
```

The script modification would look something like:

```typescript
// After Claude exits
console.log("Do you want to switch to the task worktree directory? (y/n)");
const response = await new Promise(resolve => {
  process.stdin.once('data', data => {
    resolve(data.toString().trim().toLowerCase());
  });
});

if (response === 'y') {
  // Output a special command that the shell wrapper can interpret
  console.log(`##DIRCHANGE##${worktreeDir}`);
}
```

## Test Plan 🧪

- [ ] Test the solution with bash, zsh, and fish shells
- [ ] Verify the directory changes correctly when user selects 'y'
- [ ] Verify the directory remains unchanged when user selects 'n'
- [ ] Test with both absolute and relative paths
- [ ] Test across different operating systems (macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Test with different task IDs and worktree locations
