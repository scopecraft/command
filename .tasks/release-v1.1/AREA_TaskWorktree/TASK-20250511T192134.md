## Description

Currently, when working on tasks in a worktree, Claude is launched without any pre-authorized tools. This means users need to manually authorize tools like Edit, Read, Glob, etc. for each new session, creating friction in the development workflow.

This task involves documenting and implementing pre-authorized tools when launching Claude in a task worktree context, focusing on security, user experience, and workflow improvement.

## Current Implementation

In `src/scripts/task-worktree.ts`, Claude is launched with:

```typescript
const claudeProcess = Bun.spawn(['claude', `/project:task-context ${taskId}`], {
  stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit'],
  cwd: worktreeDir,
});
```

## Objectives

1. Document how to use Claude's `--allowedTools` flag to pre-authorize tools
2. Identify which tools should be pre-authorized for a typical development workflow
3. Implement configuration options for pre-authorized tools
4. Enhance the current worktree feature to include these pre-authorizations
5. Update documentation to reflect these changes

## Requirements

### 1. Implement Pre-authorized Tools

- Modify the `task-worktree.ts` script to use the `--allowedTools` flag when launching Claude
- Pre-authorize a set of default tools needed for development tasks:
  - File operations: `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `LS`
  - Search operations: `Glob`, `Grep`
  - Execution: `Bash` (with limited permissions)
  - Task management: MCP-specific tools like `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_update`

### 2. Configuration System

- Add a configuration option to specify which tools should be pre-authorized
- Implement this in one of two ways:
  - Option A: Configuration file in `.tasks/config/worktree-tools.json`
  - Option B: Command-line arguments to override defaults

### 3. Security Considerations

- Document security implications of pre-authorizing tools
- Ensure Bash permissions are appropriately constrained
- Provide guidance on which tools are safe to pre-authorize

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Update `docs/WORKTREE-USAGE.md` to explain the pre-authorized tools feature
- Document how to customize the pre-authorized tools list
- Include examples of common use cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Documentation

1. Document the syntax and options for Claude's `--allowedTools` flag
2. Create a recommended list of tools to pre-authorize
3. Draft documentation for the feature

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. Update `src/scripts/task-worktree.ts` to include pre-authorized tools:

```typescript
// Example implementation with default tools
const defaultAllowedTools = [
  'Read', 'Edit', 'MultiEdit', 'Write', 'LS',
  'Glob', 'Grep',
  'Bash[cmd=git*;cmd=bun*;cmd=npm*;cmd=node*]',
  'mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_update',
  'mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list',
  'mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_get'
];

// Join the tools array into the format expected by Claude
const allowedToolsArg = `--allowedTools=${defaultAllowedTools.join(',')}`;

// Launch Claude with pre-authorized tools
const claudeProcess = Bun.spawn(
  ['claude', allowedToolsArg, `/project:task-context ${taskId}`], 
  {
    stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit'],
    cwd: worktreeDir,
  }
);
```

2. Implement configuration loading from `.tasks/config/worktree-tools.json`
3. Add command-line options to override default tools

### Phase 3: Testing

1. Test the implementation with various tools
2. Verify that tools are properly pre-authorized
3. Test configuration overrides
4. Check security constraints

### Phase 4: Documentation Finalization

1. Update `docs/WORKTREE-USAGE.md` with the new feature
2. Add examples and best practices
3. Document security considerations

## Benefits

- **Improved Developer Experience**: Eliminate the need to authorize common tools repeatedly
- **Faster Workflow**: Reduce friction when starting work on a new task
- **Consistency**: Ensure all developers use the same set of pre-authorized tools
- **Configurability**: Allow customization for different projects and requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Claude launches with pre-authorized tools when starting a new task worktree
- [ ] Configuration system allows customization of pre-authorized tools
- [ ] Documentation is updated to explain the feature
- [ ] Security considerations are documented
- [ ] The implementation is tested with various tools and scenarios
