# Comprehensive Task Detail Option

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** A comprehensive task detail option for phase/feature list operations
* **Why is it needed?** Currently requires multiple API calls to get full task information for all tasks in a phase/feature
* **Scope:** Add include_task_details parameter to phase_list and feature_list methods
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Add include_task_details parameter to phase_list and feature_list endpoints
* - [ ] Return complete task details when parameter is true
* - [ ] Optimize performance to handle potentially large responses
* - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
* - [ ] Update documentation with new parameter options

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design response format for include_task_details=true option
* - [ ] Implement optimized task loading with full content
* - [ ] Add pagination or chunking for large task sets
* - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces
* - [ ] Create tests for the new functionality

## Current Behavior

Requires multiple API calls to get full task information for all tasks in a phase/feature.

## Proposed Behavior

Add include_task_details parameter to return complete task content alongside metadata:

```json
{
  "include_tasks": true,
  "include_task_details": true
}
```

Response would include full task content alongside metadata, reducing the need for multiple API calls.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Balance between response size and completeness
* Consider pagination options for large task sets
* Optimize database/file system queries to minimize overhead
* Include options to filter which task details are included
