# Dedicated Tree View Command

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** A dedicated tree view command that returns a hierarchical representation of the project
* **Why is it needed?** No built-in way currently exists to visualize the entire project hierarchy
* **Scope:** Create new tree_view command with hierarchical representation of phases, features, and tasks
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Create new tree_view command for MCP server
* - [ ] Return hierarchical representation of phases, features, areas, and tasks
* - [ ] Include options for depth and detail level
* - [ ] Provide formatted output for CLI usage
* - [ ] Add proper documentation

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design response schema for hierarchical data
* - [ ] Implement tree construction algorithm
* - [ ] Add filtering options (by phase, status, etc.)
* - [ ] Create formatter for CLI output
* - [ ] Add pagination or chunking for large projects
* - [ ] Create tests for the tree_view functionality

## Current Behavior

No built-in way to visualize the entire project hierarchy, requiring multiple calls and client-side processing.

## Proposed Behavior

Add a tree_view command that returns a hierarchical representation:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "tree": [
      {
        "type": "phase",
        "id": "phase-1-mvp",
        "name": "Phase 1 - MVP Mockup",
        "status": "🟡 Pending",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "feature",
            "id": "FEATURE_setup-infrastructure",
            "name": "Setup and Infrastructure",
            "status": "🟡 To Do",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "task",
                "id": "TASK-20250514T165332",
                "title": "Create Campaign Data Types",
                "status": "🟡 To Do"
              },
              {
                "type": "task",
                "id": "TASK-20250514T165337",
                "title": "Setup Mock Campaign Service",
                "status": "🟡 To Do"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "message": "Generated project tree view"
}
```

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Efficient tree construction algorithm
* Handling of orphaned tasks or features
* Options for depth limiting to prevent oversized responses
* Caching strategies for large projects
