# Improved Parent-Child Relationship Handling

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** Enhanced parent-child relationship handling with better error messages and repair capabilities
* **Why is it needed?** Current implementation produces confusing errors when attempting to link tasks to features/areas
* **Scope:** Improve error handling, add relationship repair commands, implement automatic ID type detection
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Enhance error handling for parent-child relationships with clear guidance
* - [ ] Add repair/link command for fixing relationship issues
* - [ ] Implement automatic ID type detection for relationships
* - [ ] Provide validation checks before relationship creation
* - [ ] Update documentation with relationship best practices

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Audit current error messages for parent-child operations
* - [ ] Design new repair_relationships command
* - [ ] Implement ID validation and type detection
* - [ ] Create integrity checks for relationship operations
* - [ ] Add tests for relationship handling edge cases
* - [ ] Update documentation and error messages

## Current Behavior

Errors like "Could not update parent task FEATURE_setup-infrastructure: Task with ID FEATURE_setup-infrastructure not found" when attempting to link tasks to features.

## Proposed Behavior

Clearer errors with guidance, plus a repair command for fixing parent-child relationships:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__repair_relationships": {
  "task_id": "TASK-20250514T165332",
  "parent_id": "FEATURE_setup-infrastructure"
}
```

With automatic detection of ID types (feature, area, task) and proper validation.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Entity type detection based on ID patterns and directory structure
* Relationship validation to prevent circular dependencies
* Consistent error message formatting with helpful suggestions
* Rollback mechanisms for failed relationship operations
