# Enhanced Task Listing in Collection Views

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** Enhanced task listing in collection views to provide more detailed metadata in API responses
* **Why is it needed?** Current task listings in collection views only show IDs, requiring multiple API calls to get useful information
* **Scope:** Modify phase_list, feature_list, and related collection endpoints to include configurable task metadata
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Add configurable metadata fields to collection view responses
* - [ ] Support preset view formats (brief, standard, detailed, full)
* - [ ] Implement optimized responses based on requested detail level
* - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing API contracts
* - [ ] Update documentation with new parameter options

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design parameter schema for customizable fields
* - [ ] Implement formatter functions for different view formats
* - [ ] Add field filtering logic to task_list handler
* - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces for responses
* - [ ] Add pagination support for large collections
* - [ ] Create tests for new functionality

## Current Behavior

When using phase_list or feature_list with include_tasks: true, only task IDs are returned:

```json
"tasks": [
  "TASK-20250514T165332",
  "TASK-20250514T165337"
]
```

## Proposed Behavior

Tasks should include basic metadata in collection views:

```json
"tasks": [
  {
    "id": "TASK-20250514T165332",
    "title": "Create Campaign Data Types",
    "status": "🟡 To Do",
    "tags": []
  },
  {
    "id": "TASK-20250514T165337",
    "title": "Setup Mock Campaign Service",
    "status": "🟡 To Do",
    "tags": []
  }
]
```

With full control over which fields are included based on parameters.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Add parameter for `fields` to specify which metadata fields to include
* Create preset view formats (brief, standard, detailed, full)
* Implement formatter functions for different output contexts
* Optimize response size based on requested detail level
* Add pagination support for large collections
