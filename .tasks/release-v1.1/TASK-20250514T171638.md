# Enhanced Filtering Capabilities

## Description ✍️

* **What is this feature?** Enhanced filtering capabilities across all entity types
* **Why is it needed?** Current filtering options in list commands are limited
* **Scope:** Add richer filtering capabilities to task_list, phase_list, feature_list, and other listing commands
* **Links:** N/A

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Implement advanced filtering with complex logic (AND, OR, NOT)
* - [ ] Add date range filtering (created_after, updated_before, etc.)
* - [ ] Support filtering by multiple values for single fields
* - [ ] Add full-text search across task content
* - [ ] Implement sorting options for all list endpoints
* - [ ] Update documentation with comprehensive filtering examples

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [ ] Design filters parameter schema for consistent filtering across methods
* - [ ] Implement filters parser and validator
* - [ ] Create query builder for complex filter logic
* - [ ] Add advanced text search capabilities
* - [ ] Implement sorting with multiple fields and directions
* - [ ] Create tests for advanced filtering scenarios

## Current Behavior

Limited filtering options in list commands, typically supporting only exact matches on single fields.

## Proposed Behavior

Add richer filtering capabilities across all entity types:

```json
"mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list": {
  "filters": {
    "status": ["🟡 To Do", "🟠 In Progress"],
    "tags": ["UX"],
    "created_after": "2025-05-13",
    "assigned_to": "davidpaquet"
  },
  "sort": {
    "field": "priority",
    "direction": "desc"
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Considerations

* Flexible filter expression parser
* Optimization for common filter patterns
* Query optimization for large task sets
* Support for filter composition and reuse
* Consistent filter semantics across all entity types
