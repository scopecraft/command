## Description

Implement the `archivePhase` function to mark phases as completed but preserve all content.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement `archivePhase` function in task-manager.ts
  - Mark phase as archived in configuration file
  - Update phase status to "✅ Complete" or "🗄️ Archived"
  - Maintain all tasks and relationships
  - Add ability to exclude archived phases from listings by default

## Acceptance Criteria

- Phase archive operation marks a phase as complete but preserves all content
- Archived phases are hidden from default listings but accessible with a flag
- System preserves the "never delete" policy for all content
- Error handling follows existing patterns with clear messages

## Implementation Notes

- The archive feature should:
  - Use a status field to mark phases as "✅ Complete" or "🗄️ Archived"
  - Add an `archived` boolean property to phase objects if needed
  - Implement show/hide behaviors in list functions with a parameter
- Consider whether to add a "complete" vs "archive" distinction or use a single state
