## Description

Update documentation to reflect the new phase management capabilities and task filtering enhancements.

## Tasks

- [x] Update documentation with new phase operations
  - [x] Document all new commands and options
  - [x] Add examples for common phase management scenarios
  - [x] Update MCP documentation with new methods
  - [x] Include guidance on task organization with MDTM directories

## Acceptance Criteria

- README.md is updated with new commands and examples
- CLAUDE.md includes guidance on phase management
- MCP method documentation shows all new phase operations
- Documentation includes examples for common user scenarios
- Both CLI and MCP interfaces are covered in documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Include real-world examples that demonstrate practical usage
- Ensure consistency in terminology across all documentation
- Update any diagrams or visualizations to reflect new capabilities
- Consider adding a specific guide for phase management workflows

## Implementation Log

1. **Updated CLAUDE.md** with new sections:
   - Added detailed phase management best practices
   - Created examples for common phase management scenarios including creation, transitions, and renaming
   - Enhanced MDTM directory structure guidance with phase-feature-area organization
   - Added hierarchical organization examples with directory structure visualization

2. **Verified MCP Tool Documentation** is complete:
   - Confirmed all phase operations are properly documented in mcp-tool-descriptions.md
   - Verified parameters and examples are accurate

3. **Added Real-World Examples**:
   - Created practical scenario examples showing phase lifecycle management
   - Added examples for common operations like phase creation, renaming, and status updates

4. **Enhanced Directory Structure Guidance**:
   - Added guidance on how phases interact with features and areas
   - Created visual examples of directory structure
   - Added best practices for organizing tasks across phases
