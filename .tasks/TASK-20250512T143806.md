## UX Planning Phase - React Task UI

This task focuses on planning the user experience for the React Task Management UI application.

### Goals
- Design an intuitive interface for managing MDTM tasks
- Create a cohesive user experience that follows Scopecraft's design aesthetics
- Plan for all required user interactions and flows
- Consider accessibility and usability best practices

### Main Task List Interface

#### Visual Design
- **Theme**: Terminal-inspired dark theme using Matrix-like color palette
  - Background: Near-black (#0D0208)
  - Text: Bright green (#00FF41)
  - Primary elements: Medium green (#008F11)
  - Secondary elements: Dark green (#003B00)
  - Accent: Varying shades of green
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono as the primary font for terminal aesthetics
- **Layout**: Clean, minimal UI with appropriate spacing

#### Task Table Implementation
- **Component**: shadcn Table component built on TanStack Table
- **Features**:
  - Sortable columns (status, priority, type, title, dates)
  - Filtering capabilities (by status, type, priority, phase, tags)
  - Search functionality with debounced input
  - Pagination for large task sets
  - Row selection for batch operations
- **Column Visibility**: Toggle columns on/off based on user preference
- **Data Handling**: Client-side operations for local file-based tasks

#### Filtering and Search UI
- **Toolbar Design**: Compact toolbar with search field and filter dropdowns
- **Filter Tags**: Visual indicators of active filters with clear options
- **Advanced Filtering**: Optional Notion-like filtering panel for complex queries
- **Saved Filters**: Allow users to save and reuse common filter combinations

### Task Creation/Editing Form

#### Form Design
- **Layout**: Multi-section form with logical grouping of related fields
- **Implementation**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Sections**:
  1. Basic Info: title, type, status, priority, phase
  2. Relations: parent tasks, dependencies, previous/next tasks
  3. Content: Markdown editor with preview pane
  4. Metadata: tags, dates, assignee

#### Content Editing
- **Editor**: Split-pane approach with editor and preview
- **Markdown Support**: react-markdown with remark-gfm for GitHub-flavored markdown
- **Toolbar**: Formatting options for common markdown elements

### Task Relationship Visualization

#### Graph Implementation
- **Library**: React Flow or a similar graph visualization library
- **Node Design**: Tasks represented as nodes with status/priority indicated by color
- **Edge Design**: Relationships shown as directional lines (dependencies, parent-child, sequential)
- **Interactions**: Pan, zoom, select, and edit relationships directly in the graph

#### Visualization Controls
- **Filtering**: Show only specific relationship types
- **Layout Algorithms**: Different view options (hierarchical, force-directed, etc.)
- **Detail Levels**: Toggle between simplified and detailed views

### User Flows for CRUD Operations

#### Create Task Flow
1. User clicks "New Task" button in main interface
2. Form opens in a dialog/drawer (responsive - drawer on mobile, dialog on desktop)
3. User fills in required fields and optional content
4. Form validates input in real-time
5. User clicks "Create" to save the task
6. New task appears in the table with success notification

#### Read Task Flow
1. User views tasks in the main table interface with sorting/filtering
2. User clicks on a task row to expand details or view in a sidebar
3. Full task content and metadata displayed
4. Related tasks shown with links to navigate between them

#### Update Task Flow
1. User selects a task to edit (from table or visualization)
2. Edit form opens with current task data pre-populated
3. User modifies desired fields
4. Form validates changes in real-time
5. User clicks "Update" to save changes
6. Updated task reflected in the UI with success notification

#### Delete Task Flow
1. User selects one or more tasks to delete
2. Confirmation dialog appears with warning about dependencies
3. User confirms deletion
4. Tasks removed from the UI with success notification
5. Related task references updated automatically

### Accessibility Considerations

#### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility for all interactions
- Logical tab order through the interface
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Focus management for dynamic content

#### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes for dynamic content
- Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- Status announcements for important actions

#### Color and Contrast
- Sufficient contrast between foreground and background
- Visual indicators beyond color alone
- Text legibility at various sizes
- Support for Windows high contrast mode

#### Compliance Targets
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance as the minimum standard
- Regular accessibility audits using tools like axe-core-react

### Responsive Design Approach

#### Mobile Experience
- Mobile-first approach to design
- Task list optimized for vertical scrolling on small screens
- Simplified filters available through dropdown
- Form inputs sized appropriately for touch interaction
- Task editing uses full-screen drawer pattern

#### Tablet Experience
- Two-column layout for task details and list
- Split-pane editor becomes toggleable on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly controls with appropriate sizing

#### Desktop Experience
- Multi-column layout with sidebar for details
- Advanced filtering options readily accessible
- Keyboard shortcuts prominently displayed
- Task relationship visualization at full size

#### Component Adaptations
- Use shadcn UI's responsive Dialog/Drawer pattern for forms
- Collapse table columns progressively as screen size decreases
- Stack form sections vertically on smaller screens

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

#### Network and File System
- Offline support for editing tasks without immediate saving
- File conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Error recovery for parsing malformed task files

#### User Input
- Validation feedback in real-time
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Default values and suggestions for common fields

#### Empty States
- Friendly empty state for no tasks matching filters
- Guided experience for first-time task creation
- Helpful suggestions when search yields no results

### Implementation Recommendations

1. Start with shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS as foundation
2. Customize the terminal-inspired theme using CSS variables
3. Implement the task table first as the core interaction point
4. Add task creation/editing forms with validation
5. Develop task relationship visualization as an enhancement
6. Ensure responsive design throughout implementation
7. Thoroughly test accessibility before finalizing
