## Description

The `task-manager.ts` file has grown to almost 1600 lines with multiple responsibilities. This refactoring task aims to break it down into smaller, more maintainable modules that follow the single responsibility principle.

## Current State

The current `task-manager.ts` file combines several different responsibilities:
- Directory management functions
- Task CRUD operations
- Task relationship management
- Phase management
- Workflow operations

This monolithic structure makes it difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

## Proposed Structure

```
src/core/
â”œâ”€â”€ task-manager/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                # Re-exports from all files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ directory-utils.ts      # Directory operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task-crud.ts            # Basic task CRUD operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task-relationships.ts   # Relationship management between tasks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task-workflow.ts        # Next task finder and workflow operations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ phase-crud.ts           # Phase operations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.ts                # Shared utilities 
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Note**: This structure is a suggestion - feel free to adjust based on what makes the most sense during implementation. You might find that some functions belong together or that additional files are needed.

## Module Responsibilities

The suggested responsibilities below are a starting point. During implementation, you may find that some functions should be moved between modules or that additional modules are needed:

### directory-utils.ts
- `getTasksDirectory()`
- `getPhasesDirectory()`
- `ensureDirectoryExists()`
- Any other file system utility functions

### task-crud.ts
- `listTasks()`
- `getTask()`
- `createTask()`
- `updateTask()`
- `deleteTask()`
- Any helper functions specific to these operations

### task-relationships.ts
- `updateRelationships()`
- Functions to handle parent-child relationships
- Functions to handle sequential (previous/next) relationships
- Functions to handle dependencies
- Any other relationship-specific utilities

### task-workflow.ts
- `findNextTask()`
- Task prioritization logic
- Task sequencing logic
- Workflow-specific utilities

### phase-crud.ts
- `listPhases()`
- `createPhase()`
- `updatePhase()`
- `deletePhase()`
- Phase status management
- Phase-task relationship management

### utils.ts
- Shared helper functions
- Common validation functions
- Reusable error handling

### index.ts
- Re-export all functions from the module

## Refactoring Recipe

This is a flexible approach to the refactoring - adjust as needed:

1. **Start with analysis**:
   - Identify interdependencies between functions
   - Note which functions call each other
   - Create a dependency graph if helpful

2. **Create incrementally**:
   - Start with a single module (e.g., directory-utils or utils)
   - Move functions one by one, updating imports as you go
   - Run tests frequently to catch issues early
   - Consider using a feature flag or environment variable to toggle between old and new code during transition

3. **Refactoring strategies**:
   - **Approach A - Extract and redirect**: 
     1. Extract functions to new modules
     2. Update the original file to re-export from the new modules
     3. Update imports in dependent files gradually
     4. Remove the original file once all imports are updated

   - **Approach B - Parallel implementation**:
     1. Implement the new module structure alongside the original
     2. Build a compatibility layer to ensure both can work
     3. Switch components to use new implementation one by one
     4. Remove the original once all components are migrated

   - **Approach C - Feature branches**:
     1. Create a branch for each module
     2. Implement and test each module independently
     3. Merge branches and resolve conflicts
     4. Finalize the integration

4. **Function grouping options**:
   - You may find that some functions work better in different modules than suggested
   - Feel free to create additional modules if needed (e.g., task-status.ts, file-operations.ts)
   - Consider grouping by data type, operation type, or logical cohesion

5. **Progressive enhancement**:
   - Consider improving function signatures if appropriate
   - Add better error handling or logging if needed
   - Improve type safety where possible
   - Add comments and documentation

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests** for each module:
   - Write focused tests for each file covering main functionality
   - Use mocks for file system and inter-module dependencies
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test combinations of related functions
   - Verify that modules interact correctly
   - Consider using test doubles for external dependencies

3. **E2E CLI Command Testing**:
   - Test all CLI commands against the refactored modules
   - Use a temporary directory structure to avoid affecting real data
   - Compare output with expected results
   - Test using both entity-command format and legacy format

4. **Test-Driven Approach (Optional)**:
   - Write tests for the new modules before implementing them
   - Use the existing implementation as a reference for expected behavior
   - Run tests against both old and new code during transition

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Run existing tests against refactored code
   - Ensure all functionality still works as expected
   - Compare output of old and new implementations for key operations

## Implementation Checklist

This checklist is a guide - you may need to adjust based on your findings:

- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Analyze function dependencies
- [ ] Decide on implementation strategy
- [ ] Implement core utility functions first
- [ ] Implement directory utilities 
- [ ] Implement task CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement relationship management
- [ ] Implement workflow operations
- [ ] Implement phase operations
- [ ] Create index.ts with appropriate exports
- [ ] Write unit tests for each module
- [ ] Write integration tests for module interactions
- [ ] Update import paths in dependent files
- [ ] Run existing tests against refactored code
- [ ] Benchmark performance before and after
- [ ] Document any API changes or improvements
- [ ] Remove original task-manager.ts file

## Benefits

1. Improved code organization and readability
2. Better separation of concerns
3. Easier maintenance and extension
4. More focused testing
5. Reduced cognitive load when working on specific parts of the codebase
6. Possibility to optimize imports (only import what's needed)
7. Foundation for future improvements and optimizations

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and existing tests

**Risk**: Increased complexity due to module interdependencies
**Mitigation**: Careful design of module boundaries and clear documentation

**Risk**: Performance impact from additional imports/exports
**Mitigation**: Monitor performance metrics and optimize if necessary

**Risk**: Incomplete refactoring leaves system in mixed state
**Mitigation**: Plan for complete transition or create clean compatibility layer

## Additional Considerations

1. **Documentation**: Update code documentation to reflect the new structure
2. **Version Control**: Consider using feature branches for each module
3. **Code Reviews**: Get feedback on module boundaries early
4. **Refactoring Scope**: Be clear about what's in scope (just reorganization or also improving implementations)
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all existing API consumers continue to work

Remember that the goal is maintainable, modular code - not perfect adherence to an initial plan. Adapt the approach based on what you discover during implementation.
