# Implementation Plan Phase - React Task UI

## Objectives
Create a detailed roadmap for developing the task management interface with clear phases and dependencies.

## Planning Tasks
- [x] Create detailed roadmap for development
- [x] Break down implementation into logical phases with dependencies
- [x] Research modern CI/CD practices
- [x] Research current testing strategies
- [x] Plan for error handling and edge cases
- [x] Design performance optimization strategy
- [x] Create specific implementation steps

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
1. Initialize project with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2. Configure shadcn UI with terminal-inspired theme
3. Set up project structure according to component architecture
4. Create direct integration with existing core library
5. Implement basic Context providers for state management
6. Create basic layout components (AppLayout, Header, Sidebar, ContentArea)

### Phase 2: Core Task Management UI
1. Implement TaskListView with TanStack Table
2. Add task filtering and search functionality
3. Create TaskDetailView for viewing task details
4. Develop TaskFormView for creating and editing tasks
5. Implement dynamic template handling and field generation
6. Create markdown content editor with preview

### Phase 3: Relationship Visualization and Enhancements
1. Implement task relationship visualization with React Flow
2. Add quick editing capabilities from list and graph views
3. Create toast notifications and basic error handling
4. Implement responsive design adaptations
5. Build and deploy with Bun HTTP server

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Objective:** Set up project structure and integrate with core library.

**Tasks:**
- Initialize project with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Configure shadcn UI with terminal-inspired theme
- Set up project structure and component organization
- Create TaskContext and integration hooks for core library
- Implement basic layout components

**Deliverables:**
- Working project setup with core library integration
- Basic navigation structure
- Terminal-inspired theme configuration

### Phase 2: Task Management UI
**Objective:** Implement core task management functionality.

**Tasks:**
- Create TaskTable component with TanStack Table
- Implement basic filtering and search functionality
- Create TaskFormView for creating and editing tasks
- Add template-based field generation
- Implement markdown editor for task content
- Create task detail view

**Deliverables:**
- Functioning task list with sorting and filtering
- Task creation and editing functionality
- Dynamic template-based forms
- Basic markdown content editing

### Phase 3: Enhancement and Deployment
**Objective:** Add relationship visualization and deploy application.

**Tasks:**
- Create RelationshipGraphView with React Flow
- Implement quick editing capabilities
- Add responsive design for different screen sizes
- Create simple toast notification system
- Implement Bun HTTP server for deployment

**Deliverables:**
- Interactive relationship graph showing task connections
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Ready-to-use application with Bun HTTP server

## Error Handling Strategy

### UI Error Handling
- Implement toast notifications for operation results
- Add inline form validation feedback
- Use error boundaries for component-level errors
- Create fallback UI for failed component rendering
- Display user-friendly error messages

### API Error Handling
- Add consistent error handling for core library integration
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Create detailed error logging for debugging
- Handle file system permissions and access errors
- Validate input data before sending to core functions

## Performance Optimization

### UI Performance
- Use React.memo for pure components
- Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Add virtualization for large task lists
- Use efficient rendering patterns (avoiding unnecessary re-renders)
- Implement code splitting for larger feature modules

### State Management
- Optimize context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use optimistic updates for better perceived performance
- Implement efficient filtering and sorting algorithms
- Cache computed values where appropriate
- Batch state updates when possible

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Verify core task operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Test filtering and searching functionality
- Validate form submission and validation
- Check relationship visualization rendering
- Test responsive layouts on different screen sizes

### Automated Testing
- Focus on critical business logic with unit tests
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Implement simple snapshot tests for UI components
- Add linting and type checking for code quality
