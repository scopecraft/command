# Brainstorm - Areas should just exist as tag + document.

Areas shouldnt exist as folder that can receive features underneath.

Instead, they should be a a tag and an area could contain documents and general features inside this area (similar to module).

This way, it wouldnt be a OR. A feature is part of an area, and can be delivered inside a phase.
