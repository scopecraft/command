## Research Phase - React Task UI

This task documents research findings for the React Task Management UI application.

### Core Requirements and Functionality

- Local-only interface for MDTM files with TOML/YAML frontmatter
- CRUD operations for tasks through the UI
- Tabular task display with sorting and filtering
- Task content editing with Markdown support
- Integration with existing core task management functions
- Support for all task metadata fields
- Task relationship visualization
- Phase management capabilities

### User Problems Solved

- Provides a visual interface for managing tasks instead of CLI-only
- Enables easier task organization and filtering
- Simplifies viewing task relationships and dependencies
- Improves task content editing experience with preview
- Makes task status updates more intuitive

### React Patterns and Hooks

#### Recommended Patterns
- Container/Presentational pattern for separation of concerns
- Feature-based organization for maintainable code structure
- Service layer pattern for integration with existing core functionality

#### Recommended Hooks
- `useState` and `useReducer` for local component state
- `useContext` for global application state
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimizations where needed
- Custom hooks for repeated logic like task filtering, sorting, etc.

### Modern React Libraries

#### UI Components
- shadcn UI (latest): Highly customizable component library built on Radix UI primitives
- Integrated with Tailwind CSS for styling flexibility
- Provides excellent accessibility support

#### Task Table Display
- shadcn Table component (built on TanStack Table)
- Supports sorting, filtering, pagination, and virtualization

#### Markdown Rendering
- react-markdown with appropriate plugins for rendering task content
- remark-gfm for GitHub-flavored markdown support

#### Form Handling
- React Hook Form for efficient form state management
- Zod for schema validation

### State Management

- For this application size, Context API with custom hooks should be sufficient
- No need for Redux or other complex state management solutions
- Local component state for UI-specific state (form fields, etc.)
- Global context for shared state (current task list, filters, etc.)

### Technical Architecture

- Vite for build tooling (fast development experience, optimized builds)
- TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience
- Feature-based folder structure for better organization
- Service layer to abstract core functionality interaction
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### MDTM File Parsing
- Leverage existing core functionality for parsing MDTM files
- Create adapter functions to integrate with React components

#### Markdown Editing
- Use a split-pane approach with editor and preview
- Consider CodeMirror or Monaco Editor for enhanced editing experience

#### Task Relationships
- Implement visual indicators for task relationships
- Consider a graph visualization for complex relationship networks

#### Performance
- Implement virtualization for large task lists using react-window or similar
- Use pagination and filtering on the client side for improved user experience
- Optimize rendering with appropriate memoization

### Package Recommendations

- Vite: Modern build tool with fast HMR
- React 19: Latest version with improved rendering optimizations
- TypeScript: For type safety and better developer experience
- shadcn UI: Customizable UI components based on Radix UI
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- react-markdown: For rendering Markdown content
- React Hook Form: For efficient form handling
- Zod: For schema validation
- react-window (optional): For virtualized lists if needed

### Updated Based on User Feedback

- Will keep the application lean by using Vite and focusing on essential packages
- Recognize that extensive performance optimizations aren't critical for a local-only application parsing files from a local filesystem
- Will focus on UI functionality rather than performance considerations when choosing components
- Will maintain the Scopecraft visual identity throughout the UI design
