# Bug: Task Creation Issues in Feature Planning Workflow

## Summary
Multiple issues were encountered when creating tasks for the feature planning command:
1. Duplicate task IDs when creating tasks rapidly in parallel
2. Inconsistent behavior with subdirectory vs phase
3. Child tasks not inheriting parent feature's phase

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate Task IDs
- **Problem**: When creating multiple tasks in a batch, all received the same timestamp-based ID (TASK-20250518T050504)
- **Impact**: Only one task was actually created, others were silently rejected
- **Root Cause**: ID generation uses timestamp without milliseconds, causing collisions in rapid creation

### 2. Subdirectory vs Phase Confusion
- **Problem**: Tasks created with `subdirectory: "FEATURE_command-discovery"` went to root `.tasks/` directory
- **Expected**: Should go to `.tasks/FEATURE_command-discovery/` or require phase
- **Actual**: Tasks placed in root with subdirectory as metadata only
- **Workaround**: Must specify both phase and subdirectory for proper placement

### 3. Parent Feature Phase Not Inherited
- **Problem**: Tasks with `parent: "command-discovery"` didn't inherit the feature's backlog phase
- **Expected**: Child tasks should default to parent's phase if not specified
- **Actual**: Tasks created without phase go to root directory

### 4. Silent Failures on Duplicate IDs
- **Problem**: No error returned when task creation fails due to duplicate ID
- **Expected**: Should return error indicating duplicate ID issue
- **Actual**: Success response but task not created

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create feature in backlog phase: `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_create`
2. Create multiple tasks rapidly with same parent
3. Observe:
   - All tasks get same ID
   - Only first task is created
   - No error messages
   - Tasks without phase go to root

## Expected Behavior
1. Each task should get unique ID (add milliseconds or counter)
2. Child tasks should inherit parent's phase by default
3. Subdirectory alone should place tasks in subdirectory folder
4. Duplicate ID attempts should return clear error

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Fix ID Generation
```typescript
// Add milliseconds or counter to ensure uniqueness
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
const counter = getIncrementingCounter(); // Thread-safe counter
const id = `TASK-${timestamp}-${counter}`;
```

### 2. Inherit Parent Phase
```typescript
if (parent && !phase) {
  const parentTask = await getTask(parent);
  if (parentTask.phase) {
    phase = parentTask.phase;
  }
}
```

### 3. Fix Subdirectory Behavior
- Either: Subdirectory without phase creates in root subdirectory
- Or: Require phase when subdirectory is specified
- Document the expected behavior clearly

### 4. Return Errors on Duplicate IDs
```typescript
if (taskExists(id)) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: `Task with ID ${id} already exists`
  };
}
```

## Impact
- High: Affects core task creation functionality
- Blocks efficient feature planning workflow
- Causes confusion about task organization

## Priority
High - Core functionality affecting development workflow
