# Feature Proposal: Full-Text Search Across All Task Data

## Problem Statement
Currently requires multiple manual operations to find tasks, wasting time and Claude's context. Searching happens multiple times per hour. Task descriptions often contain important implementation details that are hard to rediscover, especially for Claude when context resets.

## Proposed Solution
Implement full-text search across all task data (titles, descriptions, content, metadata) with relevance ranking. This will provide a single, unified search interface accessible through both CLI and MCP, allowing users and AI assistants to quickly find relevant tasks based on any text content.

## Key Benefits
- Eliminates multiple manual search operations
- Preserves valuable Claude context by reducing search iterations
- Quick access to historical implementation details in completed tasks
- Improves productivity for both human users and AI assistants

## Scope Definition
### Included
- Full-text indexing of all task fields (title, description, content, metadata)
- Search across both active and completed tasks
- Results ranked by relevance
- CLI command for searching
- MCP endpoint for programmatic access
- Sub-second response time for typical queries

### Not Included
- Complex filtering or faceting options
- Advanced query syntax (beyond basic text search)
- Search result highlighting
- Saved searches or search history
- Real-time index updates (batch indexing is sufficient)

## Technical Approach
The implementation will utilize standard full-text search patterns, indexing all task content into a searchable structure. The search functionality will be exposed through both the CLI and MCP interfaces, maintaining consistency with existing command patterns. Integration points will include the task manager for data access and the formatter for result presentation.

## Complexity Assessment
**Overall Complexity**: Medium

Factors:
- Standard full-text search problem
- Multiple interface points (CLI, MCP)
- Performance considerations for larger task sets
- Integration across different task states
- NO time estimates (AI-assisted development makes them obsolete)

## Dependencies & Risks
### Technical Dependencies
- Existing task manager infrastructure
- Current CLI command structure
- MCP server framework

### Risks
- Index size growth with task volume (mitigated by efficient indexing)
- Search quality dependent on content quality
- Potential performance impact on systems with large task counts

## Open Questions
1. Should search results include task relationships (parent/child tasks)?
2. What relevance ranking algorithm would work best for task content?
3. Should the index persist between sessions or rebuild on startup?
4. How to handle search in task attachments (if any)?

## Success Criteria
- Single query searches across all task fields
- Results returned in under 1 second for typical task volumes
- Both CLI and MCP interfaces provide identical search results
- Search finds tasks by any text content (title, description, or body)
- Completed tasks included in search results

## Human Review Required
- [ ] Assumption: Search frequency of "multiple times per hour" is typical usage pattern
- [ ] Derived requirement: Including completed tasks is necessary based on v2 feature development mention
- [ ] Success criteria: Sub-second response time is adequate for current task volume
- [ ] Complexity assessment accuracy based on current codebase
- [ ] Hidden dependencies or integration challenges
