# Feature Specification: Full-Text Search Across All Entities [DRAFT]

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive full-text search capability that allows rapid discovery of tasks, features, and areas by searching across all their fields, addressing the current workflow pain point of searching for entities multiple times per hour.

**Note:** This PRD supersedes the earlier task [TASK-20250514T171650](/tasks/TASK-20250514T171650) "Cross-Entity Search and Relationship Queries" by providing a more detailed specification.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. Provide full-text search across all entity types: tasks, features, and areas
2. Search all fields within each entity (title, description, content, metadata)
3. Include both active and completed entities in search results
4. Return results ranked by relevance with most relevant matches first
5. Execute searches in under 1 second for typical data volumes
6. Support case-insensitive search across all fields
7. Display search results with entity type, status, phase indicators
8. Enable search through both CLI and MCP interfaces
9. Include search result count and execution time in output
10. Support both general search and entity-specific search

### Technical Requirements
- Build search index appropriate for runtime context
- Use efficient search library suitable for markdown content
- Handle special characters and markdown syntax in search queries
- Provide clean fallback when no results found
- Maintain index integrity across entity operations
- Support concurrent search operations

## UI/UX Design
### Task UI Integration (Must Have)
- Replace existing task table search bar with new search engine backend
- Maintain current UI placement and interaction patterns
- Ensure seamless transition from frontend-only to engine-powered search
- Display search results in existing table format
- Preserve filtering and sorting capabilities

### Future UI Considerations (To Be Planned)
- Global search in application header
- Search integration in feature/area views
- Quick search widget/command palette
- Advanced search filters UI
- Search history/saved searches

### CLI User Flow
1. User invokes general search: `sc search "implementation details"`
2. System searches across all entities (tasks, features, areas)
3. Results displayed grouped by entity type, ordered by relevance
4. User can refine with entity-specific search: `sc search task "implementation"`
5. User selects specific result to view full details

### Key CLI Interactions
- `sc search <query>`: Search all entities
- `sc search task <query>`: Search only tasks
- `sc search feature <query>`: Search only features  
- `sc search area <query>`: Search only areas
- `sc search <query> --json`: JSON output for programmatic use
- `sc search <query> --limit 10`: Limit result count

### MCP Integration
- New tool: `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__search`
- Parameters: `query` (required), `type` (optional), `limit` (optional)
- Returns: Array of entities with relevance scores

## Technical Design
### Components Affected
- `task-manager/index.ts`: Add search functionality to core
- `cli/commands.ts`: Add new search command
- `mcp/handlers.ts`: Implement MCP search endpoint
- `formatters.ts`: Add search result formatting
- **`tasks-ui/src/components/task-list/TaskListView.tsx`**: Update existing search bar
- Feature and area managers: Integrate with search system

### Search Library Evaluation
Evaluate lightweight search libraries for initial implementation:
- Fuse.js - Pure JS, fuzzy search capabilities
- Lunr.js - Established full-text search
- MiniSearch - Tiny but powerful
- Orama - Modern, TypeScript-first, vector-ready

Selection criteria:
- TypeScript support
- Memory efficiency
- Markdown content handling
- Future vector search capability
- Active maintenance

### Architecture Considerations
**Index Management**: Different runtime contexts require different strategies:
- CLI: Rebuilds index on each invocation (stateless)
- UI/MCP: Long-running processes need live index updates
- Consider: incremental updates, rebuild triggers, or persistence
- Implementation team to determine optimal approach based on performance testing

## Implementation Notes
- Start with task search as proof of concept
- Leverage existing task UI search bar for immediate user benefit
- Extend to features and areas once core is stable
- Use phased rollout to validate approach
- Consider caching strategies for repeated queries
- Monitor performance with larger datasets
- Plan for future vector/semantic search capabilities

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for search functionality across entity types
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- MCP endpoint tests
- UI integration tests for task table search
- Performance tests with various data volumes
- Edge cases: empty queries, special characters, no results
- Cross-entity search validation
- Runtime context testing (CLI vs long-running)

## Phased Implementation
### Phase 1: Core Search Infrastructure
- Implement search library integration
- Create basic search index structure
- Add task search functionality
- Replace task UI search bar backend
- CLI command for task search

### Phase 2: Entity Expansion
- Extend to features and areas
- Implement entity-specific search commands
- Add general cross-entity search

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- MCP endpoint implementation
- Advanced filtering options
- Performance optimizations
- Additional UI integration points (planned separately)

## Task Breakdown Preview
- Core: Implement search infrastructure with chosen library
- Core: Add search method for tasks
- UI: Replace task table search with new engine (must have)
- CLI: Create search command for tasks
- Core: Extend search to features and areas
- CLI: Add entity-specific search commands
- CLI: Implement general cross-entity search
- MCP: Add search endpoint handler
- Tests: Comprehensive test suite
- Docs: Update documentation with examples
- Future: Plan additional UI search integration points

## Human Review Required

### Technical decisions needing verification:
- [ ] Search library selection appropriate for project needs
- [ ] Index management strategy for different runtime contexts
- [ ] Phased implementation approach sensible
- [ ] Performance targets realistic

### Design decisions to confirm:
- [ ] Task UI search replacement approach appropriate
- [ ] Future UI integration points correctly scoped
- [ ] CLI command structure intuitive
- [ ] Entity-specific vs general search balance
- [ ] Result display format in existing UI

### Implementation concerns:
- [ ] Task breakdown captures all integration points
- [ ] Runtime context differences properly addressed
- [ ] Future vector search path remains open
- [ ] Testing strategy comprehensive
- [ ] UI transition plan smooth for users

### Key Assumptions to Discuss:
- Multiple searches per hour indicates significant friction
- Users want to search across all entity types
- Both general and specific search commands valuable
- Search library approach better than custom implementation
- Existing task UI search bar is primary integration point
- Additional UI search points can be planned separately
