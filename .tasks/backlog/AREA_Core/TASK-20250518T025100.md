# Feature Specification: Command Discovery and Contextual Execution System

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

This PRD has been successfully planned and broken down into implementation tasks. The feature has been organized as FEATURE_command-discovery with 6 core tasks and 1 future enhancement task.

### What Was Accomplished:
- âœ… Created comprehensive feature plan with proper task granularity
- âœ… Improved feature planning instructions based on learnings
- âœ… Documented issues discovered during dogfooding
- âœ… Created 6 implementation tasks with todo lists
- âœ… Created 1 future enhancement task for advanced features

### Feature Tasks Created:
1. Research and Design Command Discovery System
2. Implement Core Command Discovery Module  
3. Implement CLI Commands Integration
4. Add MCP Command Discovery Tools
5. Build UI Command Selection Features
6. Integration Testing and Comprehensive Documentation
7. Advanced Command Discovery Features (future enhancements)

The full feature implementation can be found in `.tasks/backlog/FEATURE_command-discovery/`

## Original PRD Content

## Overview
Implement a lightweight command discovery system in core that allows clients (CLI, MCP, UI) to list available Claude commands and execute them with automatically injected context, eliminating manual ID copying and providing a foundation for future command orchestration.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Provide command discovery API that reads from a centralized metadata JSON file
2. The metadata file contains information for all commands (similar to phases.json pattern)
3. Support simple `$ARGUMENTS` string replacement in command templates
4. Enable listing of all available commands with filtering by category
5. Allow retrieval of command content with `$ARGUMENTS` replaced
6. Support both direct execution (CLI) and template return (MCP/UI)
7. Include command categorization (planning, implementation, testing, etc.)
8. Support autonomous/interactive mode specification in metadata

### Technical Requirements
- Load metadata file on each request (no caching)
- Use Zod schemas for metadata file validation and type generation
- Async/await patterns for file operations
- Clear error messages for invalid metadata or missing command files
- Consider cross-platform compatibility if implementation allows
