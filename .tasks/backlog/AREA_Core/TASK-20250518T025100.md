# Feature Proposal: Command Discovery and Contextual Execution System

## Problem Statement
Users must manually copy context (task IDs, feature details) when launching AI commands, and there's no centralized way to discover or execute available commands across different clients. This creates workflow friction and prevents future orchestration capabilities.

## Proposed Solution
Create a minimal command discovery system in core that allows clients to list and execute Claude commands with pre-filled context. Core provides discovery infrastructure while each client (CLI, MCP, UI) handles execution in their preferred manner.

## Key Benefits
- Eliminates manual context copying when launching commands
- Provides unified command discovery across all clients
- Lays foundation for future automated orchestration

## Scope
### Included
- Command discovery API in core
- Command manifest structure for metadata
- Basic client integrations (CLI, MCP, UI)
- Context injection mechanism

### Not Included
- Automated command orchestration
- Command chaining logic
- Complex UI/UX for command selection
- Command authoring tools

## Technical Approach
Add lightweight discovery system to core that scans `.claude/commands/` directory and provides metadata through a manifest. Clients can retrieve command list and content, then handle execution according to their patterns (CLI spawns process, MCP returns for agent execution, UI injects into prompt field).

## Implementation Estimate
2-3 days including core API, manifest structure, and initial client integrations.

## Dependencies
- Existing Claude command infrastructure
- Current UI POC for context passing
- MCP tool system for command operations

## Risks
- Commands may evolve beyond simple $ARGUMENTS replacement
- Different AI providers may have incompatible formats
- Manifest schema may need iterations

## Open Questions
- Should manifest be JSON or YAML?
- How to handle command versioning?
- Should commands declare required context types?

### Human Review Required
- [ ] Assumption: Commands will continue using $ARGUMENTS replacement pattern
- [ ] Derived conclusion: Manifest-based approach is preferred over directory scanning
- [ ] Pattern-based suggestion: Each client should handle execution differently
- [ ] Area assignments: Core, UI, CLI, and MCP all affected
- [ ] Effort estimate: 2-3 days based on minimal implementation scope
