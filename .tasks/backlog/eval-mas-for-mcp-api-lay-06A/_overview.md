## Instruction
Investigate Mastra as a potential evolution path for our MCP + API layer to support better orchestration and lightweight LLM/agent integration.

**Strategic Context**: This is an exploratory initiative to assess whether Mastra could enhance our current MCP implementation with better orchestration capabilities and more sophisticated agent integration patterns.

**Risk Mitigation**: Designed for incremental evaluation - can spike independently, integrate gradually, or even run alongside existing MCP during transition.

## Orchestration Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Parallel)
- Research Mastra capabilities and architecture
- Analyze integration patterns with existing MCP
- Evaluate orchestration features vs current needs

### Gate: Direction Decision
**Decision Point**: Does Mastra offer sufficient value to proceed with prototyping?
**Criteria**: 
- Clear advantages over current MCP approach
- Feasible integration path identified
- Orchestration capabilities align with needs

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept (To be created after gate)
Tasks will depend on research findings:
- Spike implementation if promising
- Comparative testing if uncertain
- Integration prototype if clearly beneficial

### Phase 3: Integration Strategy (To be created after PoC)
Approach depends on PoC results:
- Gradual migration plan
- Side-by-side operation strategy
- Full replacement roadmap

## Tasks
