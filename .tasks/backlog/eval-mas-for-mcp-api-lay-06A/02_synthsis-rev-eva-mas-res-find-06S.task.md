# Synthesis Review: Evaluate Mastra Research Findings

---
type: chore
status: todo

## Instruction
Synthesize findings from the parallel research tasks to make strategic decisions about Mastra integration.

**Gate Decision**: Should we proceed with Mastra integration, and if so, what approach?

**Synthesis Activities**:
1. **Consolidate Research**: Combine findings from architecture, orchestration, and agent research
2. **Assess Value Proposition**: Does Mastra offer compelling advantages?
3. **Evaluate Integration Complexity**: What's the effort vs benefit ratio?
4. **Risk Assessment**: What are the potential downsides?
5. **Strategic Decision**: Choose path forward based on evidence

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Clear Value**: Mastra must offer significant improvements over current MCP
- **Feasible Integration**: Reasonable effort to integrate with existing system
- **Risk Tolerance**: Acceptable complexity and potential issues
- **Strategic Alignment**: Fits with overall system architecture goals

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Proceed with Spike**: Build proof-of-concept to validate findings
2. **Gradual Integration**: Start with specific features/capabilities
3. **Defer Decision**: Need more information or different timing
4. **No Integration**: Current MCP approach is sufficient

**Next Phase**: Based on decision, create appropriate Phase 2 tasks
