## Instruction
Research Mastra's core capabilities, architecture, and positioning to understand how it could enhance our current MCP + API layer.

**Key Areas to Investigate**:
1. **Core Architecture**: How Mastra structures services, APIs, and integrations
2. **MCP Compatibility**: Can it consume/extend existing MCP implementations?
3. **Orchestration Capabilities**: What orchestration patterns does it support?
4. **Agent Framework**: Built-in patterns for LLM/agent integration
5. **Performance & Scalability**: How it handles concurrent operations
6. **Documentation Quality**: Maturity and completeness of docs

**Research Sources**:
- Official Mastra documentation
- GitHub repository and examples
- Community discussions and use cases
- Architecture diagrams and patterns

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive overview document covering architecture, capabilities, and potential fit for our use case.
