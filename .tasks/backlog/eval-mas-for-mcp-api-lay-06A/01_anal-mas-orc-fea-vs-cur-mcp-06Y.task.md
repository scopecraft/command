## Instruction
Compare Mastra's orchestration features against our current MCP patterns to identify potential improvements and integration opportunities.

**Analysis Focus**:
1. **Current MCP Patterns**: Document our existing orchestration approach
2. **Mastra Orchestration**: How Mastra handles workflow coordination
3. **Gap Analysis**: What capabilities are we missing?
4. **Integration Opportunities**: Where could Mastra enhance current patterns?
5. **Migration Complexity**: Effort required for different integration approaches
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Can we maintain current MCP while adding Mastra?

**Key Questions**:
- Does Mastra offer better patterns for task coordination?
- Can it integrate with our existing MCP handlers?
- What new orchestration capabilities would it unlock?
- How would it impact current AI agent interactions?

**Deliverable**: Comparative analysis document with integration recommendations.
