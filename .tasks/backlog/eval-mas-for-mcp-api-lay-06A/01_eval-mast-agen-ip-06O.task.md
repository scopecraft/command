## Instruction
Evaluate Mastra's agent integration patterns and lightweight LLM capabilities to understand how they could enhance our task management system.

**Research Areas**:
1. **Agent Architecture**: How Mastra structures and manages agents
2. **LLM Integration**: Patterns for lightweight LLM usage
3. **Task Management Integration**: How agents could enhance our workflow
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrating multiple lightweight agents
5. **State Management**: How agents maintain context across operations
6. **Performance Patterns**: Efficient patterns for agent-driven workflows

**Key Questions**:
- What agent patterns does Mastra provide out of the box?
- How could lightweight agents enhance our task management?
- What coordination patterns work well for multiple agents?
- How does this compare to our current AI integration?

**Deliverable**: Agent integration analysis with recommendations for task management enhancement.
