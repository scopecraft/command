## Instruction
Add comprehensive tests for API response consistency across all MCP endpoints. Include specific test cases for flat structure validation, field name consistency, type field normalization (no emojis), parent task detection using single field, and progress data availability.

## Tasks
- [ ] Write tests for consistent response structure
- [ ] Test flat structure validation
- [ ] Test field name consistency across endpoints
- [ ] Test type field normalization (no emojis)
- [ ] Test parent task detection using single task_type field
- [ ] Test progress data availability for parent tasks
- [ ] Add tests for field presence across endpoints
- [ ] Test error response formats
- [ ] Add integration tests for full workflows
- [ ] Document expected responses in tests
