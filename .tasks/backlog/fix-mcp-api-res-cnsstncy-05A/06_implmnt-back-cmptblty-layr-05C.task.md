## Instruction
**SKIP THIS SUBTASK** - No backward compatibility needed.

Since we're working in the V2 implementation branch that hasn't been merged to main yet, there are no existing API consumers to maintain compatibility with. The MCP API is evolving and this is the perfect time to implement breaking changes without compatibility layers.

**Rationale:**
- V2 branch hasn't been released/merged
- No production API consumers to maintain
- Clean implementation preferred over compatibility overhead
- MCP clients expect APIs to evolve during development

## Tasks
- [x] Assess need for backward compatibility (CONCLUSION: Not needed)
- [x] Document rationale for skipping backward compatibility
- [ ] N/A - Skip implementation

## Deliverable
**NO IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED**

Documentation of decision to skip backward compatibility:
- V2 branch is pre-release, no existing consumers
- Clean implementation without compatibility overhead
- Focus resources on robust new schema instead
