## Instruction
Complete the full API normalization cleanup and create comprehensive documentation for consumers of the MCP handlers. Remove all orphaned code, ensure single entry point, and provide clear guidance for UI team and other API consumers.

**Final Cleanup Requirements:**
- Remove all orphaned old handler functions from handlers.ts
- Consolidate all normalized handlers into single entry point
- Ensure methodRegistry is the single source of truth
- Clean up imports and dead code
- Verify all endpoints use consistent normalized format

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Create comprehensive handler consumer guide
- Document single import pattern for UI team
- Provide examples of all normalized API calls
- Document field name mappings (old vs new)
- Include Zod schema integration examples

## Tasks
- [ ] Remove all orphaned old handler functions from handlers.ts
- [ ] Clean up unnecessary imports and dead code
- [ ] Consolidate normalized handlers architecture (decide on file structure)
- [ ] Ensure methodRegistry is the single authoritative entry point
- [ ] Verify all read and write operations use consistent response format
- [ ] Test complete API consistency across all endpoints
- [ ] Create comprehensive handler consumer documentation
- [ ] Document single import pattern: `import { methodRegistry } from 'handlers.js'`
- [ ] Provide examples of all normalized read operations
- [ ] Provide examples of all normalized write operations
- [ ] Document field name changes (locationâ†’workflowState, assigned_toâ†’assignee)
- [ ] Document clean enum usage ("feature" not "ðŸŒŸ Feature")
- [ ] Include Zod schema integration examples for type safety
- [ ] Document error response format consistency
- [ ] Create migration guide from old API format to new format

## Deliverable
âœ… **Complete API Normalization:**
- Fully cleaned codebase with no orphaned handler code
- Single entry point: methodRegistry in handlers.ts
- All read and write operations use consistent normalized format
- Complete API consistency achieved

ðŸ“š **Handler Consumer Documentation:**
- Comprehensive consumer guide: `mcp-handler-consumer-guide.md`
- Single import pattern documentation
- Complete API examples for all operations
- Field name mapping reference
- Zod schema integration guide
- Migration guide from old to new format
- Ready for UI team integration

## Log

- 2025-05-30: Completed API cleanup and documentation. Removed all orphaned handler functions, consolidated architecture with single entry point (methodRegistry), created comprehensive consumer guide, removed deprecated workflow methods that duplicated task_list functionality, and verified all tests pass.
