## Instruction
Update core to MCP mappings if needed to support the new flat response structure. Focus on ensuring core provides all needed data for the flat structure and handle emoji stripping at the appropriate layer. The mapping layer should transform core's internal format to the consistent API format.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review current core-to-MCP data flow
- [ ] Ensure core provides all needed data for flat structure
- [ ] Determine appropriate layer for emoji stripping
- [ ] Update mapping functions to transform to new format
- [ ] Ensure all required fields are available from core
- [ ] Handle optional fields appropriately
- [ ] Test transformations with various task types

## Deliverable
