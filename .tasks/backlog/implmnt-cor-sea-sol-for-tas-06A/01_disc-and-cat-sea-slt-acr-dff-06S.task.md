## Instruction
Discover and catalog search solutions across different categories with a focus on local-first, extensible architectures. Consider solutions that can handle diverse content types including structured data (tasks), unstructured documents, and streaming logs.

Key evaluation dimensions:
- Local-first indexing (no cloud dependencies)
- Extensibility to new content types without major refactoring
- Support for faceted search
- Ability to handle both static files and streaming content
- Memory efficiency for diverse content
- Partial content indexing (e.g., user vs assistant messages in sessions)
- Graph capabilities for relationship tracking (tasks → subtasks, documents → references)

Consider both traditional search engines and graph-aware solutions that could handle:
- Task dependency chains
- Document cross-references
- Session → task relationships
- Knowledge graph construction

## Tasks
- [x] Research lightweight in-process search libraries (npm ecosystem)
- [x] Explore embedded databases with search capabilities (e.g., SurrealDB in embedded mode)
- [x] Investigate lightweight search servers (e.g., TypeSense, MeiliSearch)
- [x] Look for innovative/emerging search solutions in the JS/TS ecosystem
- [x] Check for graph databases that could handle both search and relationships
- [x] Research vector/semantic search options if relevant
- [x] Catalog solutions by architecture type
- [x] Note licensing, maintenance status, and community health
- [x] Create initial filtering criteria based on basic requirements
