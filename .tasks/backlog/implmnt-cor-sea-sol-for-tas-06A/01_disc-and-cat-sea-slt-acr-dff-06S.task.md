## Instruction
Discover and catalog a comprehensive range of search solutions that could work within our Node.js/TypeScript architecture. Cast a wide net across different architectural approaches, from lightweight in-process libraries to embedded databases with search capabilities to lightweight search servers.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research lightweight in-process search libraries (npm ecosystem)
- [ ] Explore embedded databases with search capabilities (e.g., SurrealDB in embedded mode)
- [ ] Investigate lightweight search servers (e.g., TypeSense, MeiliSearch)
- [ ] Look for innovative/emerging search solutions in the JS/TS ecosystem
- [ ] Check for graph databases that could handle both search and relationships
- [ ] Research vector/semantic search options if relevant
- [ ] Catalog solutions by architecture type
- [ ] Note licensing, maintenance status, and community health
- [ ] Create initial filtering criteria based on basic requirements

## Deliverable
Comprehensive catalog of search solutions organized by architecture type:

1. **In-Process Libraries**
   - Pure JS/TS libraries that run in the same process
   - No external dependencies
   - Examples found with pros/cons

2. **Embedded Databases**
   - Databases that can run embedded with search capabilities
   - Include SurrealDB and similar solutions
   - Note resource requirements

3. **Lightweight Search Servers**
   - Standalone but lightweight search engines
   - Include TypeSense and alternatives
   - Deployment complexity assessment

4. **Innovative Approaches**
   - Novel solutions discovered
   - Hybrid approaches
   - Future-looking options

For each solution, document:
- Basic architecture and deployment model
- Key features relevant to our use case
- Rough resource requirements
- Community/maintenance status
- Initial gut feeling on fit
