## Instruction
Research and evaluate lightweight JavaScript/TypeScript search libraries suitable for in-process search without external dependencies. Focus on libraries that can handle both structured metadata and unstructured text content.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Performance**: Index/search speed, memory footprint
2. **Features**: Fuzzy search, filters, facets, highlighting
3. **Flexibility**: Custom ranking, tokenization, stemming
4. **Maintainability**: Active development, documentation, TypeScript support
5. **Size**: Bundle size for UI integration

## Libraries to Evaluate
- lunr.js - Established, lightweight full-text search
- FlexSearch - High performance, memory efficient
- MiniSearch - Modern, feature-rich alternative
- Fuse.js - Fuzzy search focused
- Elasticlunr - lunr.js with more features
- search-index - More advanced but heavier

## Testing Approach
Create benchmark tests with sample task data:
- 1000 tasks with content and metadata
- 100 work documents of varying sizes
- Test indexing speed, search speed, memory usage
- Evaluate search quality with test queries

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up benchmark environment with sample data
- [ ] Evaluate lunr.js capabilities and performance
- [ ] Test FlexSearch with task/document data
- [ ] Assess MiniSearch features and flexibility
- [ ] Compare Fuse.js fuzzy search quality
- [ ] Review other alternatives briefly
- [ ] Create comparison matrix
- [ ] Write performance benchmark results
- [ ] Document pros/cons for each option

## Deliverable
Comprehensive comparison report including:
- Feature comparison matrix
- Performance benchmark results
- Code examples for each library
- Recommendation with rationale
- Risk assessment for each option
