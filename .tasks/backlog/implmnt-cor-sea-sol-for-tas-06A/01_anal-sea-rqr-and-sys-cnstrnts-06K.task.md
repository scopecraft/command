## Instruction
Analyze our specific search requirements and system constraints to create clear evaluation criteria for search solutions. Focus on understanding what we need to search, how users will search, and what constraints we must work within.

## Tasks
- [ ] Document all searchable content types (task metadata, content, documents)
- [ ] Analyze typical search patterns and use cases
- [ ] Define performance requirements (latency, throughput)
- [ ] Assess resource constraints (memory, CPU, storage)
- [ ] Identify deployment constraints (single process, multi-instance, etc.)
- [ ] Determine integration requirements (MCP, UI, CLI)
- [ ] Consider future scalability needs
- [ ] Define search quality requirements
- [ ] Identify any special features needed (fuzzy search, filters, facets)
- [ ] Document version-awareness requirements for search results

## Deliverable
Detailed requirements document with:

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Types of content to search
   - Data volume estimates (current and projected)
   - Structure of searchable data
   - Update frequency patterns

2. **User Requirements**
   - Common search patterns
   - Expected query types
   - Response time expectations
   - Result quality needs

3. **System Constraints**
   - Deployment model limitations
   - Resource budgets (memory, CPU)
   - Integration touchpoints
   - Development constraints

4. **Feature Requirements**
   - Must-have features
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Future considerations
   - Deal-breakers

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Weighted scoring framework
   - Pass/fail criteria
   - Trade-off priorities
   - Risk tolerance levels
