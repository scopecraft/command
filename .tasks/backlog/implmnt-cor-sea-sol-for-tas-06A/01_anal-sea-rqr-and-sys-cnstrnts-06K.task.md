## Instruction
Analyze the complete search requirements and system constraints for Scopecraft's search solution.

Core Requirements:
- Task content and metadata search
- Work document search
- Version-aware ranking
- Local-first architecture (index stored in ~/.scopecraft/, not in git)
- Sub-100ms latency, <50MB footprint
- 95%+ relevant results in top 5

Extensibility Requirements:
- Architecture must support adding new content types post-launch
- Future: AI session search (.sessions/ directory)
- Future: Selective content indexing (e.g., user messages vs full transcripts)
- Future: Graph-based relationship tracking

Relationship Tracking (Future):
- Task → Subtask hierarchies
- Document → Document references
- Session → Task associations
- Cross-cutting links and dependencies
- Knowledge graph construction from content

Search UX Requirements:
- Faceted search support (filter by type: task, document, session)
- Relevance-based ranking across content types
- Context-aware results (show why something matched)
- Future: "Find related" functionality using graph

Technical Constraints:
- Must integrate cleanly with MCP and UI layers
- Cannot depend on external services
- Must handle incremental updates efficiently
- Should support both exact and fuzzy matching
- Graph features optional for MVP but architecture should support

## Tasks
- [ ] Document all searchable content types (task metadata, content, documents)
- [ ] Analyze typical search patterns and use cases
- [ ] Define performance requirements (latency, throughput)
- [ ] Assess resource constraints (memory, CPU, storage)
- [ ] Identify deployment constraints (single process, multi-instance, etc.)
- [ ] Determine integration requirements (MCP, UI, CLI)
- [ ] Consider future scalability needs
- [ ] Define search quality requirements
- [ ] Identify any special features needed (fuzzy search, filters, facets)
- [ ] Document version-awareness requirements for search results

## Deliverable
Detailed requirements document with:

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Types of content to search
   - Data volume estimates (current and projected)
   - Structure of searchable data
   - Update frequency patterns

2. **User Requirements**
   - Common search patterns
   - Expected query types
   - Response time expectations
   - Result quality needs

3. **System Constraints**
   - Deployment model limitations
   - Resource budgets (memory, CPU)
   - Integration touchpoints
   - Development constraints

4. **Feature Requirements**
   - Must-have features
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Future considerations
   - Deal-breakers

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - Weighted scoring framework
   - Pass/fail criteria
   - Trade-off priorities
   - Risk tolerance levels

## Log
- 2025-06-09: Updated to include local-first requirement, faceted search, and future extensibility needs for session search
- 2025-06-09: Added graph/relationship tracking as future requirement for handling links, references, and knowledge relationships
