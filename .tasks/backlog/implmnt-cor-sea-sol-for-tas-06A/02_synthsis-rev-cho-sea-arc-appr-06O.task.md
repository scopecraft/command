## Instruction
Synthesize findings from the three parallel research streams to make an informed architecture decision for our search solution. Review the discovered solutions, requirements analysis, and evaluation results to select the best approach.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review catalog of discovered search solutions
- [ ] Analyze requirements and constraints documentation
- [ ] Study evaluation results and benchmarks
- [ ] Identify top 2-3 candidates based on all research
- [ ] Document trade-offs for each candidate
- [ ] Consider long-term implications
- [ ] Make architecture recommendation
- [ ] Define high-level integration approach
- [ ] Identify key risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Present decision rationale

## Deliverable
Architecture decision document with:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Selected solution and rationale
   - Key benefits and trade-offs
   - Implementation approach

2. **Decision Analysis**
   - How each top candidate scored
   - Why the selected solution won
   - What we're giving up
   - Risk assessment

3. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level design
   - Integration points
   - Deployment model
   - Migration strategy

4. **Next Steps**
   - Design phase priorities
   - Key technical decisions needed
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline implications

## Log

## Synthesis goals
1. Review and compare search library evaluation results
2. Align indexing strategy with chosen library capabilities
3. Finalize ranking approach based on performance constraints
4. Make go/no-go decision on each major component
5. Define the architecture for Phase 2 design work

## Decision criteria
- **Performance**: Must meet latency and resource targets
- **Features**: Must support required search capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Sustainable long-term solution
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and eventually replace
- **Risk**: Acceptable technical and schedule risk

## Key decisions required
1. Primary search library selection
2. Index structure and update strategy
3. Ranking algorithm and tuning approach
4. Architecture pattern (service, library, hybrid)
5. Integration approach for MCP and UI
