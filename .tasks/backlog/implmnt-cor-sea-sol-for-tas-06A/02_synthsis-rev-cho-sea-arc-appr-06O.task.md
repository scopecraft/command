## Instruction
Review findings from Phase 1 research and select the search architecture approach for Scopecraft.

Synthesis Goals:
1. Review all three research outputs
2. Identify consensus and conflicts
3. Make architectural decision
4. Document rationale

Key Decision Factors:
- **Extensibility**: How easily can we add session search later?
- **Local-first**: No external dependencies, all data in ~/.scopecraft/
- **Performance**: Meet our targets with room for growth
- **Maintenance**: Long-term viability and community support
- **Integration**: Clean boundaries with existing services

Deliverables:
- Selected search solution/approach
- Architecture decision record (ADR)
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- Phase 2 design task definitions

Considerations for session search extension:
- Separate index vs unified index?
- Incremental indexing strategy for active sessions
- Privacy boundaries (what not to index)
- Faceted search implementation approach

## Tasks
- [ ] Review catalog of discovered search solutions
- [ ] Analyze requirements and constraints documentation
- [ ] Study evaluation results and benchmarks
- [ ] Identify top 2-3 candidates based on all research
- [ ] Document trade-offs for each candidate
- [ ] Consider long-term implications
- [ ] Make architecture recommendation
- [ ] Define high-level integration approach
- [ ] Identify key risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Present decision rationale

## Deliverable
Architecture decision document with:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Selected solution and rationale
   - Key benefits and trade-offs
   - Implementation approach

2. **Decision Analysis**
   - How each top candidate scored
   - Why the selected solution won
   - What we're giving up
   - Risk assessment

3. **Architecture Overview**
   - High-level design
   - Integration points
   - Deployment model
   - Migration strategy

4. **Next Steps**
   - Design phase priorities
   - Key technical decisions needed
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline implications

## Log
- 2025-06-09: Updated gate criteria to include extensibility assessment and local-first architecture considerations

## Synthesis goals
1. Review and compare search library evaluation results
2. Align indexing strategy with chosen library capabilities
3. Finalize ranking approach based on performance constraints
4. Make go/no-go decision on each major component
5. Define the architecture for Phase 2 design work

## Decision criteria
- **Performance**: Must meet latency and resource targets
- **Features**: Must support required search capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Sustainable long-term solution
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and eventually replace
- **Risk**: Acceptable technical and schedule risk

## Key decisions required
1. Primary search library selection
2. Index structure and update strategy
3. Ranking algorithm and tuning approach
4. Architecture pattern (service, library, hybrid)
5. Integration approach for MCP and UI
