## Instruction
Synthesize findings from the three parallel research tasks and make architectural decisions for the search implementation.

## Synthesis Goals
1. Review and compare search library evaluation results
2. Align indexing strategy with chosen library capabilities
3. Finalize ranking approach based on performance constraints
4. Make go/no-go decision on each major component
5. Define the architecture for Phase 2 design work

## Decision Criteria
- **Performance**: Must meet latency and resource targets
- **Features**: Must support required search capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Sustainable long-term solution
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and eventually replace
- **Risk**: Acceptable technical and schedule risk

## Key Decisions Required
1. Primary search library selection
2. Index structure and update strategy
3. Ranking algorithm and tuning approach
4. Architecture pattern (service, library, hybrid)
5. Integration approach for MCP and UI

## Tasks
- [ ] Review search library comparison results
- [ ] Assess indexing strategy feasibility
- [ ] Evaluate ranking algorithm proposals
- [ ] Identify integration risks and mitigations
- [ ] Make library selection decision
- [ ] Define high-level architecture
- [ ] Create Phase 2 task breakdown
- [ ] Document decisions and rationale
- [ ] Update parent task orchestration plan

## Deliverable
Architecture decision document including:
- Selected search library with justification
- Approved indexing strategy
- Chosen ranking approach
- High-level architecture diagram
- Risk assessment and mitigations
- Phase 2 task definitions
- Success metrics for implementation
