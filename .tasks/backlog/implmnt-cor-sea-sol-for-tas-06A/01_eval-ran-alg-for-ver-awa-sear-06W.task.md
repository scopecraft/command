## Instruction
Research and evaluate ranking algorithms that can provide intelligent, context-aware search results with special emphasis on version/time awareness.

## Research Focus
1. **Version-Aware Ranking**: Prioritize "current" over historical content
2. **Context Signals**: Workflow state, task status, recent activity
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Combine text relevance with contextual importance
4. **Decision Search**: Surface the most relevant/recent decision when multiple exist
5. **Personalization**: Consider user's recent work context

## Algorithm Categories to Explore
- TF-IDF variations with time decay
- BM25 with custom scoring functions
- Learning to Rank (if feasible for our scale)
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple signals
- Graph-based ranking for related tasks

## Key Challenges
- Balance text relevance with recency
- Handle archived vs active content
- Boost parent tasks appropriately
- Surface decisions in context
