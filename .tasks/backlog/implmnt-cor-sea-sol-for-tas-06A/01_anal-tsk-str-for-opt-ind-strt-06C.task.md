## Instruction
Analyze the structure of tasks and work documents to design an optimal indexing strategy that supports intelligent search and ranking.

## Analysis Goals
1. **Data Structure**: Map all searchable fields and their characteristics
2. **Content Types**: Categorize different content for appropriate handling
3. **Update Patterns**: Understand how data changes over time
4. **Query Patterns**: Anticipate common search scenarios
5. **Performance Requirements**: Define acceptable latency and resource usage

## Key Questions to Answer
- What fields need exact vs fuzzy matching?
- How to handle task relationships (parent/subtask)?
- What metadata should influence ranking?
- How to index versioned/historical content?
- When to update indexes (real-time vs batch)?
- How to handle work document discovery and indexing?

## Tasks
- [ ] Map task data structure and field types
- [ ] Analyze work document formats and locations
- [ ] Identify fields for filtering vs full-text search
- [ ] Design field weighting strategy
- [ ] Plan incremental indexing approach
- [ ] Define index schema structure
- [ ] Estimate index size and memory requirements
- [ ] Design update/refresh strategy
- [ ] Document query pattern examples

## Deliverable
Index design specification including:
- Complete field mapping with types
- Index schema recommendation
- Update strategy (real-time vs batch)
- Memory/storage estimates
- Query pattern catalog
- Performance targets
