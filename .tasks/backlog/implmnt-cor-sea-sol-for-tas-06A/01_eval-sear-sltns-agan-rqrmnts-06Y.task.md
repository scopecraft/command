## Instruction
Evaluate discovered search solutions against Scopecraft's requirements with focus on extensibility and local-first architecture.

Evaluation Framework:

1. **Core Functionality** (Must have)
   - Full-text search in markdown/YAML/TOML
   - Metadata filtering and faceted search
   - Sub-100ms query performance
   - <50MB memory footprint
   - Incremental indexing

2. **Architecture Quality** (Critical)
   - Local-first (no cloud dependencies)
   - Clean plugin/extension architecture
   - Streaming content support potential
   - Mixed content type handling

3. **Developer Experience**
   - TypeScript/JavaScript native
   - Simple API surface
   - Good documentation
   - Active maintenance

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - How hard to add session search later?
   - Selective content indexing capability?
   - Multi-index or unified index approach?
   - Query language extensibility?
   - **Graph support**: Can it handle relationships/links?
     - Native graph capabilities?
     - Plugin architecture for graph layer?
     - Performance impact of relationship tracking?

5. **Graph Considerations** (Nice to have)
   - Document-to-document references
   - Task dependency tracking
   - Bidirectional link support
   - Graph traversal queries
   - Knowledge graph potential

Create comparison matrix and recommend top 2-3 solutions with clear rationale. Note which solutions have graph capabilities even if not used in MVP.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select top 5-7 candidates from different architecture categories
- [ ] Create test dataset with actual task and document samples
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept integration for each candidate
- [ ] Measure indexing performance and resource usage
- [ ] Test search quality with representative queries
- [ ] Evaluate ease of integration and API design
- [ ] Assess special features (fuzzy search, filters, ranking)
- [ ] Test scalability with larger datasets
- [ ] Compare against evaluation criteria from requirements
- [ ] Document any unexpected findings or limitations

## Deliverable
Comprehensive evaluation report with:

1. **Tested Solutions**
   - Short list of evaluated options
   - Why each was selected for testing
   - What was excluded and why

2. **Test Results**
   - Performance benchmarks (indexing, search)
   - Resource usage (memory, CPU)
   - Search quality assessment
   - Feature comparison matrix
   - Integration complexity rating

3. **Practical Insights**
   - Code examples for each solution
   - Gotchas and surprises
   - Developer experience notes
   - Maintenance considerations

4. **Scoring & Recommendations**
   - Scores against evaluation criteria
   - Top 2-3 recommendations
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Risk assessment for each

5. **Architecture Implications**
   - How each solution would fit our architecture
   - Migration path considerations
   - Future flexibility assessment

## Log
- 2025-06-09: Updated evaluation criteria to emphasize extensibility, local-first operation, and future session search capabilities
- 2025-06-09: Added graph capabilities as evaluation criterion - important for future relationship and reference tracking
