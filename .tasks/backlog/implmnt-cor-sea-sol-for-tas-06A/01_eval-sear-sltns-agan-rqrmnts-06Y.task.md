## Instruction
Evaluate discovered search solutions against Scopecraft's requirements with focus on extensibility and local-first architecture.

Evaluation Framework:

1. **Core Functionality** (Must have)
   - Full-text search in markdown/YAML/TOML
   - Metadata filtering and faceted search
   - Sub-100ms query performance
   - <50MB memory footprint
   - Incremental indexing

2. **Architecture Quality** (Critical)
   - Local-first (no cloud dependencies)
   - Clean plugin/extension architecture
   - Streaming content support potential
   - Mixed content type handling

3. **Developer Experience**
   - TypeScript/JavaScript native
   - Simple API surface
   - Good documentation
   - Active maintenance

4. **Future-Proofing**
   - How hard to add session search later?
   - Selective content indexing capability?
   - Multi-index or unified index approach?
   - Query language extensibility?
   - **Graph support**: Can it handle relationships/links?
     - Native graph capabilities?
     - Plugin architecture for graph layer?
     - Performance impact of relationship tracking?

5. **Graph Considerations** (Nice to have)
   - Document-to-document references
   - Task dependency tracking
   - Bidirectional link support
   - Graph traversal queries
   - Knowledge graph potential

Create comparison matrix and recommend top 2-3 solutions with clear rationale. Note which solutions have graph capabilities even if not used in MVP.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select top 5-7 candidates from different architecture categories
- [ ] Create test dataset with actual task and document samples
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept integration for each candidate
- [ ] Measure indexing performance and resource usage
- [ ] Test search quality with representative queries
- [ ] Evaluate ease of integration and API design
- [ ] Assess special features (fuzzy search, filters, ranking)
- [ ] Test scalability with larger datasets
- [ ] Compare against evaluation criteria from requirements
- [ ] Document any unexpected findings or limitations

## Deliverable

| FlexSearch | 4.86ms | 5.00MB | 0.07ms | 73/100 |
| Fuse.js | 0.56ms | 0.08MB | 8.83ms | 68/100 |

### Feature Matrix
| Library | Faceted | Fuzzy | Vector | Graph | TypeScript |
|---------|---------|-------|--------|-------|------------|
| Orama | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| MiniSearch | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| FlexSearch | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Fuse.js | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### 3. Practical Insights

### Code Integration Examples
```typescript
// Orama - Recommended
const searchIndex = await create({
  schema: { id: 'string', title: 'string', content: 'string', type: 'string' }
});
const results = await search(searchIndex, {
  term: 'architecture', where: { type: 'feature' }, limit: 10
});

// MiniSearch - Alternative
const miniSearch = new MiniSearch({
  fields: ['title', 'content'], storeFields: ['id', 'title']
});
const results = miniSearch.search('architecture', {
  filter: (r) => r.type === 'feature'
});
```

### Developer Experience
- **Orama**: Excellent TypeScript support, zero dependencies, comprehensive docs
- **MiniSearch**: Simple API, well-documented, battle-tested
- **FlexSearch**: Complex API, advanced features, steeper learning curve
- **Fuse.js**: Simple setup, limited customization

### Gotchas and Surprises
- **Orama**: Slightly higher indexing overhead, but excellent query performance
- **MiniSearch**: Extremely memory efficient, perfect for Scopecraft's scale
- **FlexSearch**: Fastest queries but no faceted search support
- **Fuse.js**: Query performance too slow for real-time search (8.83ms)

### 4. Scoring & Recommendations

### Scoring Methodology
- **Performance (40%)**: Query latency, memory usage, startup time
- **Search Quality (30%)**: Relevance, coverage, feature completeness
- **Integration (20%)**: API compatibility, UI/MCP integration ease
- **Maintainability (10%)**: Code quality, dependencies

### Top Recommendations

**1. Orama (88/100)** - Primary Recommendation
- ✅ Meets all performance requirements (<100ms, <50MB)
- ✅ Complete feature set including vector search for future
- ✅ Native faceted search with `where` clauses
- ✅ TypeScript-first with zero dependencies
- ⚠️ Slightly higher memory usage (0.39MB vs 0.03MB)

**2. MiniSearch (85/100)** - Memory-Optimized Alternative
- ✅ Extremely memory efficient (0.03MB)
- ✅ Fast indexing and acceptable query performance
- ✅ Perfect for current dataset scale
- ⚠️ No vector search capabilities
- ⚠️ May not scale to very large datasets

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Choose Orama if**: Future extensibility important, vector search desired, budget allows 0.4MB memory
- **Choose MiniSearch if**: Memory constraints critical, simple search needs, proven stability valued

### 5. Architecture Implications
