## Instruction
Evaluate the most promising search solutions discovered in the catalog against our defined requirements. Focus on practical testing with real project data to understand actual performance and capabilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select top 5-7 candidates from different architecture categories
- [ ] Create test dataset with actual task and document samples
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept integration for each candidate
- [ ] Measure indexing performance and resource usage
- [ ] Test search quality with representative queries
- [ ] Evaluate ease of integration and API design
- [ ] Assess special features (fuzzy search, filters, ranking)
- [ ] Test scalability with larger datasets
- [ ] Compare against evaluation criteria from requirements
- [ ] Document any unexpected findings or limitations

## Deliverable
Comprehensive evaluation report with:

1. **Tested Solutions**
   - Short list of evaluated options
   - Why each was selected for testing
   - What was excluded and why

2. **Test Results**
   - Performance benchmarks (indexing, search)
   - Resource usage (memory, CPU)
   - Search quality assessment
   - Feature comparison matrix
   - Integration complexity rating

3. **Practical Insights**
   - Code examples for each solution
   - Gotchas and surprises
   - Developer experience notes
   - Maintenance considerations

4. **Scoring & Recommendations**
   - Scores against evaluation criteria
   - Top 2-3 recommendations
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Risk assessment for each

5. **Architecture Implications**
   - How each solution would fit our architecture
   - Migration path considerations
   - Future flexibility assessment
