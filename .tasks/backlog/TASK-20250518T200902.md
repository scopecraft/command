# Implement Mermaid diagram rendering in task details

## Overview
Implement support for rendering Mermaid diagrams within task markdown content. When a code block with language "mermaid" is detected, render it as a diagram instead of plain text.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ‚úÖ Detect mermaid code blocks in markdown
- ‚úÖ Render diagrams inline with task content
- ‚úÖ Respect light/dark themes
- ‚úÖ Handle rendering errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Support all common Mermaid diagram types

## Stretch Goals
- ‚úÖ Add expand button to view diagrams in modal (implemented but has transparency issue)

## Implementation Notes
- Created MermaidDiagram component for rendering
- Integrated with ReactMarkdown via custom code component handler
- Added theme support using Mermaid's theme configuration
- Implemented error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Added modal expansion feature using Radix UI Dialog

## Known Issues
- Modal expansion feature has transparency issues in dark mode making diagrams hard to read
- Background color classes (bg-background, bg-card) not providing expected opacity
- Created TASK-20250518T213838 to track this issue

## Implementation Log
1. Researched and compared React Mermaid libraries
2. Implemented custom MermaidDiagram component
3. Integrated with TaskContent markdown renderer
4. Added theme support for light/dark modes
5. Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 build issues with @apply directives
6. Implemented stretch goal: modal expansion feature
7. Encountered and attempted to fix modal transparency issue
8. Root cause analysis revealed CSS variable opacity issues
9. Multiple fix attempts made but issue persists
10. Created bug report for future resolution

## Technical Details
- Used mermaid@11.6.0 library
- Created custom React component with useEffect for rendering
- Handled theme switching via Mermaid.initialize
- Used Radix UI Dialog for modal functionality
- Fixed CSS build issues by replacing @apply with standard properties

## Dependencies Added
