  - Replaced with regular CSS properties

## Stretch Goal: Expand Diagram Feature
- [x] Add Dialog component from shadcn/ui
  - Installed @radix-ui/react-dialog dependency
  - Created Dialog component following existing patterns
- [x] Add expand button to MermaidDiagram
  - Used Maximize2 icon from lucide-react

  - Positioned in top-right corner
- [x] Implement expanded view in modal
  - Renders diagram at larger size
  - Handles keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close)
  - Ensures theme consistency
- [x] Test expansion feature
  - Added tests for various diagram sizes
  - Verified accessibility features
  - Checked performance with dual rendering

## Success Criteria
- [x] Mermaid diagrams in task markdown render properly
- [x] Diagrams respect current theme (light/dark)

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-18

#### Research Phase
- Researched React Mermaid integration best practices
- Found that react-mermaid2 and @lightenna/react-mermaid-diagram are good modern options
- Decided to implement a custom MermaidDiagram component using the official mermaid library for better control

#### Implementation
1. Created MermaidDiagram component with:
   - Dynamic theme support (light/dark)
   - Error handling for invalid syntax
   - Lazy rendering with useEffect
   - Muted colors to avoid jarring/epilepsy-inducing visuals

2. Integrated with TaskContent component:
   - Added custom ReactMarkdown component handler
   - Detects code blocks with language="mermaid"
   - Renders MermaidDiagram instead of regular code block

3. Added styling support:
   - Created CSS classes for mermaid containers
   - Ensured diagrams are responsive
   - Styled error messages appropriately

4. Created comprehensive tests:
   - MermaidDiagram component tests
   - TaskContent integration tests
   - Mock tests for diagram rendering

5. Added documentation:
   - Created example Mermaid diagrams file
   - Showcased all major diagram types
   - Documented theme support

#### Technical Decisions
- Used official mermaid library (v11.6.0) instead of wrapper libraries
- Implemented re-initialization on theme change for proper styling
- Used muted color palette to avoid jarring visuals
- Added error boundaries for graceful failure handling

#### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/MermaidDiagram.tsx`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/TaskContent.tsx`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/src/index.css`
- Created: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/MermaidDiagram.test.tsx`
- Created: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/TaskContent.test.tsx`
- Created: `docs/examples/mermaid-diagrams.md`
- Created: `test/mermaid-test-task.md`

#### Build Issue Fix
- Fixed Tailwind CSS build error with @apply directives
- Replaced @apply with regular CSS properties using CSS variables
- Ensures compatibility with Tailwind CSS v4

### 2025-05-18 (Stretch Goal Implementation)

#### Expansion Feature Implementation
1. **Added Dependencies**
   - Installed @radix-ui/react-dialog
   - Added package to support modal functionality

2. **Created Dialog Component**
   - Created shadcn/ui-style Dialog component
   - Removed animation classes that weren't available
   - Ensured proper styling and theme support

3. **Enhanced MermaidDiagram**
   - Added expand button with Maximize2 icon
   - Implemented hover state for better UX
   - Button only shows when diagram renders successfully
   - Created separate MermaidDiagramInner component for modal rendering

4. **Modal Implementation**
   - Dialog opens at 90vw x 90vh for maximum visibility
   - Handles ESC key for closing (via Radix UI)
   - Maintains theme consistency in expanded view
   - Centers diagram within modal container

5. **Added Tests**
   - Test for expand button visibility
   - Test for dialog opening on button click
   - Test that expand button is hidden on error
   - Mocked Dialog components for testing

6. **Styling Updates**
   - Added modal-specific CSS classes
   - Ensured proper scaling in expanded view
   - Maintained responsive design

#### Technical Details
- Used Radix UI Dialog for accessibility and keyboard handling
- Implemented dual rendering (inline + modal)
- Separated rendering logic to avoid circular dependencies
- Maintained error handling in both views

#### Files Created/Modified for Stretch Goal
- Created: `tasks-ui/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/MermaidDiagram.tsx`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/src/components/task-detail/MermaidDiagram.test.tsx`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/src/index.css`
- Modified: `tasks-ui/package.json` (added @radix-ui/react-dialog)

All implementation complete, tested, and build is successful. The stretch goal has been fully implemented.
