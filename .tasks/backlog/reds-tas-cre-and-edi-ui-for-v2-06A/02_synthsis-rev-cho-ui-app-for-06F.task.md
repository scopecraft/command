# Synthesis Review: Choose UI approach for task creation/editing

---
type: chore
status: todo
area: ui

## Instruction
Review the research findings from the UI patterns exploration and make a decision on the approach for task creation and editing in V2.

### Input Required
- Research document from 01_expl-mod-ui-pat-for-cru-oprtns-06Q
- Pattern comparison matrix
- Recommendations from the research phase

### Decision Points
1. **Primary Pattern Choice**:
   - Modal-based creation/editing
   - Inline editing (like document-editor prototype)
   - Hybrid approach (modal for create, inline for edit)
   - Slide-out panel approach

2. **Technical Approach**:
   - Reuse document-editor components directly
   - Build new components inspired by document-editor
   - Create completely new approach

3. **Feature Scope**:
   - MVP: Basic create/edit functionality
   - Enhanced: Include AI-assisted features from prototype
   - Full: Section-based editing with all document-editor features

### Success Criteria
- Clear decision on UI pattern to implement
- Technical approach defined
- Scope boundaries established
- Design phase tasks can be created based on decisions
