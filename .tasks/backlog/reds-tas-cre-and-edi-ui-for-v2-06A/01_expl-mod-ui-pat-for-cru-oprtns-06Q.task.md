## Instruction
Research modern UI patterns for CRUD operations to identify best practices for the V2 create/edit functionality.

### Important Context Documents:
- @docs/SCOPECRAFT_STYLE_GUIDE.md - Visual design system with dark terminal aesthetic
- @docs/specs/scopecraft-vision.md - Unix philosophy and overall system architecture
- @docs/specs/metadata-architecture.md - Schema-driven metadata and configuration system
- @docs/specs/ai-first-knowledge-system-vision.md - Task structure and section-based documents
- @docs/brainstorming/document-editor-analysis.md - Analysis of existing prototype with recommendations

### Document Editor Prototype:
A prototype exists in the `reference/document-editor/` folder that demonstrates:
- Section-based markdown editing
- AI-powered actions (tone, improve, diagram, extract)
- Inline editing with hover actions
- Resizable panel layout

### Areas to explore:
- Inline editing patterns (see document-editor prototype)
- Modal-based forms
- Slide-out panels
- Auto-save vs explicit save
- Optimistic updates
- Form state management approaches
- Section-based editing (per document structure)
- Hybrid approaches (modal for creation, inline for editing)

## Tasks
- [ ] Review linked vision and architecture documents for context
- [ ] Analyze document-editor prototype in reference folder
- [ ] Research inline editing patterns (pros/cons, use cases)
- [ ] Analyze modal dialog patterns for creation/editing
- [ ] Explore slide-out panel patterns
- [ ] Study auto-save implementations vs save buttons
- [ ] Research optimistic UI update patterns
- [ ] Review form state management (controlled vs uncontrolled)
- [ ] Look at markdown editor integrations for section editing
- [ ] Find examples from similar task management tools
- [ ] Consider section-based editing patterns (per unified document model)

## Deliverable
UI patterns research document with:
- Pattern comparison matrix
- Best practices for each approach
- Recommendations for our use case
- Example implementations
- Decision criteria
