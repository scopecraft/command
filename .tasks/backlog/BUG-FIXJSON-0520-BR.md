## Bug Description

Claude Code has slightly changed their output format when streaming JSON, which is affecting the Task UI's ability to properly process and display the streaming JSON responses.

## Technical Context

The Task UI relies on Claude's JSON streaming format for real-time feedback during interactions. The streaming format change needs to be addressed to restore proper functionality.

### Affected Code

The primary areas that need to be updated:

1. **Client-side parsing in PromptPage.tsx** (`tasks-ui/src/components/pages/PromptPage.tsx` - especially the `handleMessage` function around lines 133-179)
   - Current parsing logic expects specific JSON structures
   - May need to update how message blocks, tool calls, and tool results are handled

2. **WebSocket streaming in claude-handler.ts** (`tasks-ui/websocket/claude-handler.ts` - around lines 100-125)
   - Reads from stdout of Claude process
   - Streams the raw content directly to the websocket client

3. **Claude process spawning in streamClaude.ts** (`tasks-ui/streamClaude.ts`)
   - Contains the command to run Claude with `--output-format stream-json`

## Steps to Fix

1. Identify the exact format changes in Claude Code's JSON streaming output
   - Compare old format vs new format samples
   - Document the specific differences

2. Update the client-side parsing logic in `PromptPage.tsx`
   - Modify the `handleMessage` function to handle both old and new formats for compatibility
   - Update type definitions if needed

3. Test with the latest Claude Code version
   - Verify all functionalities still work (text messages, tool usage, tool results)
   - Ensure streaming updates properly render in the UI

4. Add defensive parsing to handle potential future format changes
   - More robust error handling
   - Graceful degradation for unexpected formats

## Testing

- Test with multiple JSON streaming responses from Claude Code
- Verify tool calls and tool results display correctly
- Ensure streaming text updates render properly
- Check for any UI rendering issues during streaming

## Related Information

- Claude Code was recently updated which introduced the format change
- The Task UI uses WebSocket to stream Claude's responses in real-time
- The format change appears to be minor but affects the parsing logic

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-20: Initial Implementation

1. Created a comprehensive message handler system in `claude-message-handler.ts` to handle different message formats:
   - Added specialized handlers for different message types: protocol messages, system messages, legacy messages, new assistant messages, and tool results
   - Implemented format detection for proper processing
   - Added proper error handling for malformed JSON

2. Fixed `MessageDisplay.tsx` component to properly display tool results with structured data:
   - Enhanced JSON formatting and display
   - Added proper handling for nested content structures
   - Implemented collapsible views for complex data

3. Added `--verbose` flag in `streamClaude.ts` for the JSON streaming format for better debugging

4. Updated WebSocket connection to properly handle task parameters:
   - Added XML parameter handling using `<user_params>task:${message.meta}</user_params>` format
   - Made parameters more visible to Claude for proper processing

5. Updated the task_ui.md command to enhance tool result handling:
   - Added explicit instructions to use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__ tools
   - Added examples of proper tool usage
   - Prevented Claude from using the Task agent instead of specific MCP tools

6. Fixed command handling in WebSocket to ensure proper routing:
   - Automatically adding `/project:task_ui` to user prompts when needed
   - Ensuring all requests use the correct command format
   - Improved logging for better debugging

All fixes have been tested and work properly with the latest Claude JSON format, including handling tool results and properly displaying structured data in the UI.
