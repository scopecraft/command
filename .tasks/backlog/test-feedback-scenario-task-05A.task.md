## Instruction
Test task for autonomous feedback flow. This task simulates a scenario where autonomous execution needs human feedback.

Phase 1:
1. Analyze the current codebase structure
2. Encounter a decision point about implementation approach

Decision Point:
- Option A: Create a simple test implementation
- Option B: Create a comprehensive test with mocking
- Option C: Integrate with existing test framework

Phase 2:
3. Continue based on feedback received
4. Complete the implementation
5. Document the results

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze codebase structure
- [ ] Document available options
- [ ] **[FEEDBACK NEEDED]** Which implementation approach?
- [ ] Implement chosen approach
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Document results

## Deliverable
