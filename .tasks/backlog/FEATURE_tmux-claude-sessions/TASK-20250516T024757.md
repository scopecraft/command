This task contains the original PRD (Product Requirements Document) for the Task-Aware Claude Sessions feature.

## Outcome

The PRD has been:
1. Converted into FEATURE_tmux-claude-sessions
2. Broken down into 9 implementation tasks:
   - Research phase: RESEARCH-RESEARCHTMUX-0519-VV
   - Core implementation: FEAT-BUILDTMUXTS-0519-JJ, FEAT-BUILDDISPATCH-0519-35, FEAT-IMPLEMENTHEADLESS-0519-J3, FEAT-IMPLEMENTSUBTASK-0519-G4
   - Integration & UI: FEAT-AUGMENTWEBSOCKET-0519-VG, FEAT-CREATEORCHESTRATION-0519-ZB, FEAT-ADDSUBTASK-0519-2U
   - Testing & Documentation: TEST-INTEGRATIONTESTING-0519-DX

## Reference

The full PRD content is now located in the feature overview:
- Feature ID: FEATURE_tmux-claude-sessions
- Feature Title: Task-Aware Claude Sessions & Dispatch Modes
- Location: .tasks/backlog/FEATURE_tmux-claude-sessions/_overview.md

## History

This task was originally created as a PRD for implementing tmux-based Claude session management with dispatch modes. It has been successfully transformed into a feature with proper task breakdown for implementation.

## Status

Status: ‚úÖ Done - The PRD has been successfully converted to a feature and broken down into implementation tasks.

## Implementation Findings

During prototyping, we discovered several important implementation details:

1. **Tmux Window Naming**: 
   - Must explicitly disable automatic window renaming to preserve task identifiers
   - Add the following to the tmux session setup:
     ```bash
     # Global session settings
     tmux set-option -g -t "$SESSION_NAME" automatic-rename off
     tmux set-option -g -t "$SESSION_NAME" allow-rename off
     
     # After each window creation
     tmux set-window-option -t "$SESSION_NAME:$window_name" automatic-rename off
     tmux set-window-option -t "$SESSION_NAME:$window_name" allow-rename off
     ```

2. **Direct Command Execution**:
   - Claude must be executed directly as the window command, not wrapped in a script
   - Example: `tmux new-window -t session -n name -c /path "claude ..."`
   - This ensures the session remains alive when the dispatcher exits

3. **Mode System**:
   - Dynamically load modes from .claude/commands/*.md files
   - Provide a "none" mode for basic Claude sessions without commands
   - The command format is: `claude '/project:MODE TASK-ID [USER_PROMPT]'`

These findings from the prototype should guide the final implementation.
