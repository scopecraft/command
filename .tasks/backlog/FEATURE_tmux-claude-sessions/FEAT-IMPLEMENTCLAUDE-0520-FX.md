## Task: Implement Claude Session Button for Task UI

### Description
Create a UI button component for the Tasks UI that allows users to start Claude sessions for specific tasks and features. The button should check if a session already exists and provide appropriate feedback.

### Implementation Log

#### May 20-21, 2025

1. **Initial Button Component Implementation**
   - Created `SessionButton.tsx` and `SessionButton.css` for basic UI
   - Implemented session existence checking with polling
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for button props and API responses
   - Integrated button into task and feature detail views

2. **API Integration**
   - Created client-side API functions in `claude-sessions.ts`:
     - `checkSessionExists`: Checks if a session exists for a task/feature
     - `startClaudeSession`: Starts a new Claude session
   - Implemented full input validation using Zod schemas
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for request/response types

3. **Server-Side Integration**
   - Created server handlers in `claude-session-handlers.ts`:
     - `handleSessionCheck`: Checks if a tmux session exists for a task
     - `handleSessionStart`: Creates a new tmux session for a task
   - Integrated with task worktree system to create worktrees
   - Added clear logging for session operations
   - Used Bun's spawnSync for executing tmux commands

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Added toast notifications for better user feedback:
     - Info toast when session already exists (showing window name)
     - Success toast when session is started successfully
     - Error toast when session fails to start
   - Improved button state management for loading/starting/existing states
   - Simplified mode selection by defaulting to 'none' mode

5. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Added robust error handling for API failures
   - Implemented proper window name filtering to detect task-specific windows
   - Added client-side validation to prevent invalid requests

6. **Follow-up Task**
   - Created TASK-IMPLEMENTUNIFIED-0520-2K to improve worktree integration with WorktreeService

### Results
The implementation was successful and includes the following features:

1. A "START CLAUDE SESSION" button that appears on task and feature detail pages
2. Automatic checking for existing sessions with 10-second polling
3. Toast notifications for user feedback (success, error, and info states)
4. Proper loading states during session checks and creation
5. Integration with the task worktree system
6. Clear visual indication when a session is already running

### Code Structure
- **Client Components**:
  - `tasks-ui/src/components/claude/SessionButton.tsx`: Main button component
  - `tasks-ui/src/components/claude/SessionButton.css`: Styling
  - `tasks-ui/src/components/claude/index.ts`: Export wrapper

- **Client API**:
  - `tasks-ui/src/lib/api/claude-sessions.ts`: API client functions

- **Server Handlers**:
  - `tasks-ui/server/claude-session-handlers.ts`: tmux session management
  - `tasks-ui/server.ts`: API route registration

### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **tmux Session Management**: Implemented proper commands to create and check tmux sessions
2. **UI State Coordination**: Created a polling system to keep UI in sync with session state
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
4. **Type Safety**: Added complete TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
5. **User Feedback**: Integrated with toast notification system for clear feedback

### Future Improvements
The created task TASK-IMPLEMENTUNIFIED-0520-2K outlines planned improvements:
1. Integration with the upcoming WorktreeService
2. Better handling of existing worktrees
3. Enhanced error messaging
4. Streamlined reattachment to existing sessions

### Conclusion
The Claude Session Button implementation provides a seamless way for users to start AI sessions directly from the task UI. This integrates the AI workflow directly into the task management system, improving developer productivity.
