# Add task ID search to task list search bar

Enable the task list search bar to search within task ID fields in addition to current search fields.

## Problem
The search bar in the task list view doesn't search in the ID field, making it difficult to find tasks by their ID. This is a common use case when referencing specific tasks.

## Todo List
- [ ] Examine current search implementation
  - Locate search bar component in tasks-ui/src/components/task-list/
  - Identify current search fields and filtering logic
  - Find where search query is processed
- [ ] Update search functionality to include ID field
  - Add ID field to searchable fields array
  - Ensure case-insensitive matching for IDs
  - Test partial ID matching (e.g., "2024" finds all 2024 tasks)
- [ ] Verify search performance remains good
  - Test with large task lists
  - Ensure no UI lag when typing
- [ ] Test the implementation
  - Search by full task ID
  - Search by partial task ID
  - Search by date portion of ID
  - Verify other search fields still work
- [ ] Update any search help text if needed
  - Check if there's tooltip or help text listing searchable fields
  - Add ID to the list if applicable

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can search tasks by full ID (e.g., "TASK-20250518T200902")
- [ ] Can search by partial ID (e.g., "20250518" or "T2009")
- [ ] Existing search functionality remains intact
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive

## Implementation Notes
- This should be a small change to the existing filter logic
- Look for the search/filter function in TaskListView or similar
- ID field is likely already in the task data, just not included in search
- Keep the implementation simple - just add ID to searchable fields
