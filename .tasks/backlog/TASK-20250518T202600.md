# Add task ID search to task list search bar

Enable the task list search bar to search within task ID fields in addition to current search fields.

## Problem
The search bar in the task list view doesn't search in the ID field, making it difficult to find tasks by their ID. This is a common use case when referencing specific tasks.

## Todo List
- [x] Examine current search implementation
  - Locate search bar component in tasks-ui/src/components/task-list/
  - Identify current search fields and filtering logic
  - Find where search query is processed
- [x] Update search functionality to include ID field
  - Add ID field to searchable fields array
  - Ensure case-insensitive matching for IDs
  - Test partial ID matching (e.g., "2024" finds all 2024 tasks)
- [ ] Verify search performance remains good
  - Test with large task lists
  - Ensure no UI lag when typing
- [ ] Test the implementation
  - Search by full task ID
  - Search by partial task ID
  - Search by date portion of ID
  - Verify other search fields still work
- [x] Update any search help text if needed
  - Check if there's tooltip or help text listing searchable fields
  - Add ID to the list if applicable

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can search tasks by full ID (e.g., "TASK-20250518T200902")
- [ ] Can search by partial ID (e.g., "20250518" or "T2009")
- [ ] Existing search functionality remains intact
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Search is case-insensitive

## Implementation Notes
- This should be a small change to the existing filter logic
- Look for the search/filter function in TaskListView or similar
- ID field is likely already in the task data, just not included in search
- Keep the implementation simple - just add ID to searchable fields

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-18 - Initial Implementation

1. **Analyzed current search functionality**
   - Found search implementation in `TaskListView.tsx` (lines 151-155)
   - Search currently only filters by task title (case-insensitive)
   - Task interface includes `id` field that can be searched

2. **Updated search logic**
   - Modified TaskListView.tsx to include ID in search:
   ```tsx
   if (
     filters.searchTerm &&
     !task.title.toLowerCase().includes(filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase()) &&
     !task.id.toLowerCase().includes(filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase())
   )
     return false;
   ```
   - Now searches both title AND id fields (using OR logic)

3. **Updated search placeholder text**
   - Changed placeholder from "Search tasks..." to "Search by title or ID..."
   - This informs users that ID search is now available

4. **Code quality checks**
   - Ran `bun run code-check`
   - Found pre-existing complexity warnings in the file
   - My changes are minimal and focused, not introducing new issues

### Human Review Needed

Implementation decisions to verify:
- [x] Used OR logic for search (matches if either title OR id contains search term)
- [x] Maintained case-insensitive search for both fields
- [x] Updated placeholder text to indicate ID search capability

Technical assumptions:
- [x] Task ID is always present (not optional) based on interface definition
- [x] No performance issues expected as ID is a simple string comparison
- [x] No need for special handling of ID format (treating as regular string)

### Next Steps
- Test the implementation with various ID patterns
- Verify performance with large task lists
- Consider adding search help documentation if one exists
