# Design Event Sourcing Architecture

## Instruction

Design the core event sourcing architecture that will serve as the foundation for OpenTelemetry integration. This includes defining interfaces, storage format, and integration patterns with existing Scopecraft systems.

Focus on:
1. Event store interface design
2. Domain event schema and types
3. File-based storage structure (JSONL)
4. Integration with existing task/session systems
5. Performance and scalability considerations

## Tasks

- [ ] Review existing event sourcing brainstorming document
- [ ] Define EventStore interface with append/query operations
- [ ] Design DomainEvent schema with metadata
- [ ] Specify JSONL file organization and naming
- [ ] Plan integration points with existing services
- [ ] Consider performance implications of file-based storage
- [ ] Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

## Deliverable

Architecture document detailing:
- Event store interface specification
- Domain event type definitions
- File storage organization
- Integration strategy with existing systems
- Performance characteristics and limitations
