# Research OTEL Best Practices and Logging Patterns

## Objective
Research and document current best practices for implementing OpenTelemetry logging in Node.js applications, with focus on multi-module systems and rotating file exporters.

## WebSearch Queries

### OTEL Patterns
- "OpenTelemetry Node.js logging best practices 2024"
- "OTEL multi-module logger configuration patterns"
- "OpenTelemetry rotating file exporter Node.js"
- "OTEL logger performance optimization Node.js"

### Community Solutions
- "OpenTelemetry community exporters file rotation"
- "OTEL SDK logs BatchLogRecordProcessor patterns"
- "OpenTelemetry Bun.js compatibility issues"
- "OTEL structured logging attributes best practices"

### Configuration Patterns
- "OpenTelemetry environment-based configuration Node.js"
- "OTEL logger namespace conventions monorepo"
- "OpenTelemetry log levels configuration patterns"
- "OTEL SDK diagnostic logging setup"

## Questions to Answer

1. **Architecture Patterns**
   - What's the recommended way to structure OTEL in a multi-module project?
   - How should module-specific loggers be created and managed?
   - What are the performance implications of different processor types?

2. **File Exporters**
   - Which community file exporters are actively maintained for OTEL?
   - How to implement rotating file logs with size limits?
   - What are the Bun.js compatibility considerations?

3. **Configuration Management**
   - How to handle environment-specific configurations?
   - What are the best practices for log level management?
   - How to configure different exporters for dev vs production?

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - What are typical log call overhead measurements?
   - How to minimize performance impact in production?
   - What batching strategies work best?

## Research Tasks

- [ ] Investigate OTEL SDK logging architecture for Node.js
- [ ] Research community file exporters with rotation support
- [ ] Analyze configuration patterns for multi-module systems
- [ ] Study performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Document Bun.js specific considerations
- [ ] Create comparison table of different approaches
- [ ] Document findings with examples

## Expected Deliverables

1. Architecture recommendations document
2. List of suitable community exporters
3. Configuration strategy proposal
4. Performance benchmarking approach
5. Migration strategy from existing logging
6. Code examples for common patterns
