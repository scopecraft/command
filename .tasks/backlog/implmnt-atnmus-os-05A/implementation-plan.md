# Autonomous Orchestration System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation has been split into focused documents:

1. **[Phase 1 Implementation](./implementation-plan-phase1.md)** - Immediate MVP implementation focusing on Docker-enabled unified session management (2 weeks)

2. **[Long-term Vision](../../../docs/orchestration-automation-vision.md)** - Complete roadmap including Phases 2-5 and future capabilities

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Critical Finding: Docker Mode is Essential
Docker mode (using `my-claude:authenticated`) is required for:
- Full filesystem access
- Git operations (creating branches, worktrees)
- Avoiding permission fatigue
- True autonomous execution

### Current State
- Multiple session types exist (autonomous, interactive, planning, orchestration)
- No unified interface or queue management
- Docker support missing from autonomous mode
- ChannelCoder provides excellent primitives we should leverage

### Recommended Approach
1. Start with Phase 1: Docker-enabled core for autonomous sessions
2. Build on ChannelCoder's session management and streaming
3. Add other session types incrementally
4. Just make it work

## Quick Reference

### Phase 1 Focus (Current Task)
- Docker-enabled autonomous sessions using `my-claude:authenticated`
- Basic queue management (3 concurrent sessions max)
- Stream monitoring for real-time observation and intervention
- Make sure existing UI keeps working

### Key Technical Decisions
- Use ChannelCoder's session management directly
- Leverage stream parser for monitoring
- Simple in-memory queue to start
- Direct replacement, no migration complexity

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
1. Autonomous sessions run in Docker with full permissions
2. Queue prevents resource exhaustion
3. Real-time monitoring enables intervention when needed
4. Existing UI continues to work
5. Session start time <3 seconds
