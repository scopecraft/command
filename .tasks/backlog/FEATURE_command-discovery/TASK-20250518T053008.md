### 3. Enhanced Discovery Options
- Fuzzy search for commands
- Command recommendations based on context
- Command chaining/orchestration support
- Batch command execution

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Optional caching layer for metadata
- Lazy loading of command content
- Incremental updates to metadata

### 5. Developer Experience
- Command creation wizard
- Metadata validation CLI tool
