# Feature: Command Discovery and Contextual Execution System

## Problem Statement
Clients currently need to manually copy task/feature IDs to execute Claude commands, creating friction in the development workflow. There's no central way to discover available commands or understand their requirements.

## User Story
As a developer using Scopecraft Command, I want to discover and execute available commands without manual ID copying, so I can work more efficiently with AI assistants.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a lightweight command discovery system with these capabilities:
- Centralized metadata file containing all command definitions
- Simple $ARGUMENTS template replacement for context injection
- Support for multiple clients (CLI, MCP, UI)
- Category-based organization of commands
- Mode specification (autonomous/interactive)

## Technical Breakdown

### Tasks (6 total)

1. **Research and Design Command Discovery System** (AREA:core)
   - Combined research for patterns and best practices
   - Design of metadata schema and architecture

2. **Implement Core Command Discovery Module** (AREA:core)
   - Zod schema implementation
   - Discovery module with $ARGUMENTS replacement
   - Metadata file creation
   - Unit testing

3. **Implement CLI Commands Integration** (AREA:cli)
   - CLI subcommand implementation
   - Filtering and formatting
   - CLI-specific testing

4. **Add MCP Command Discovery Tools** (AREA:mcp)
   - MCP tool handlers
   - Context injection
   - MCP-specific testing

5. **Build UI Command Selection Features** (AREA:ui)
   - UI/UX design
   - React component implementation
   - UI-specific testing

6. **Integration Testing and Comprehensive Documentation** (AREA:documentation, AREA:core)
   - Full system integration tests
   - User guide and examples
   - Complete documentation

## Risks & Dependencies

### Dependencies
1. Research/Design blocks all implementation
2. Core module blocks all client implementations
3. All implementations block integration testing

### Risks
- Complex commands may not fit simple template pattern
- Performance with large metadata files
- Cross-platform path handling
- Integration with existing command system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands can be discovered via all three clients
- [ ] Context is automatically injected into commands
- [ ] System supports both autonomous and interactive modes
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage exists
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Human Review Required

### Planning Decisions to Verify
- [ ] Task granularity appropriate (6 tasks vs original 14)
- [ ] Todo lists properly structured within tasks
- [ ] Area designation via tags is correct
- [ ] Dependencies clearly identified
- [ ] Original PRD (TASK-20250518T025100) properly linked

### Technical Assumptions
- [ ] Single metadata file approach is correct
- [ ] Simple string replacement sufficient for templates
- [ ] Zod schema validation appropriate choice
- [ ] Category enumeration comprehensive
- [ ] Mode distinction (autonomous/interactive) clear
