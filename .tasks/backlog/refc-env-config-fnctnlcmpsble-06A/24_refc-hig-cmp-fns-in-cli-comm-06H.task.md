## Instruction
Refactor high-complexity functions to meet code quality standards.

**Code Smell Alert**: Biome linting identified multiple functions exceeding complexity limits:

**Critical Violations** (max allowed: 15):
1. **handleDispatchCommand** - complexity: 61 (src/cli/commands/dispatch-commands.ts)
2. **handleWorkCommand** - complexity: 46 (src/cli/commands/work-commands.ts)
3. **getSessionLogs** - complexity: 39 (src/integrations/channelcoder/monitoring.ts)
4. **execute** - complexity: 27 (location TBD)
5. **SessionStorage.save** - complexity: 25 (src/integrations/channelcoder/session-storage.ts)

**Refactoring Strategy**:

### 1. handleDispatchCommand (61 → <15)
Break down into:
- `validateDispatchOptions(options)`
- `prepareDispatchEnvironment(taskId, options)`
- `executeDispatchMode(mode, environment, options)`
- `handleDispatchError(error, context)`

### 2. handleWorkCommand (46 → <15)
Break down into:
- `validateWorkOptions(options)`
- `prepareWorkEnvironment(taskId, options)`
- `startInteractiveSession(environment, options)`
- `handleSessionResume(sessionId, options)`

### 3. getSessionLogs (39 → <15)
Break down into:
- `findSessionLogFiles(sessionId, projectRoot)`
- `parseLogEntry(line)`
- `aggregateLogStreams(logFiles)`
- `formatSessionLogs(entries)`

### 4. execute (27 → <15)
Identify the specific function and break down based on its logic

### 5. SessionStorage.save (25 → <15)
Break down into:
- `validateSessionData(session)`
- `prepareSessionMetadata(session)`
- `writeSessionFiles(metadata, logPath)`

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Extract complex conditionals into well-named functions
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Create helper functions for repeated logic
- Ensure each function has single responsibility
- Add proper error handling in extracted functions

**Success Criteria**:
- All functions have complexity ≤ 15
- No loss of functionality
- Improved readability and maintainability
- All tests still pass
- Biome linting passes without complexity warnings

  - Deliverable: READY
  - Major success: Reduced total complexity by 207 points (from 291 to 84)
  - Questions: execute function (complexity: 27) remains - may need separate task
  - Follow-up: None needed for this task scope
- 2025-06-10: - 2025-06-10: Task updated with context about parallel ChannelCoder v3 upgrade completion. Execute function still needs refactoring while preserving v3 changes.

## Edit: additional context (added 2025-06-10)
**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: Since you last worked on this task, a parallel task has modified the codebase:

### What Changed:
Task 23 (ChannelCoder v3 upgrade) has been completed and modified `client.ts`:
- ChannelCoder upgraded from v2.8.3 to v3.0.0
- Added `cwd` parameter support throughout the codebase
- The `execute` function in `client.ts` now includes:
  - A new `getProjectRoot()` helper function
  - `cwd` parameters added to all ChannelCoder calls:
    - `s.claude()` calls now include `{ ...options, cwd: projectRoot }`
    - `claude()` direct calls have `cwd` parameter
    - Session creation includes `cwd` parameter

### Your Remaining Work:
You successfully refactored 4/5 functions. The `execute` function (complexity: 27) still needs refactoring.

**Key considerations for execute function refactoring**:
1. **PRESERVE** all the new `cwd` parameter additions from the v3 upgrade
2. **MAINTAIN** the `getProjectRoot()` helper function
3. **REFACTOR** the complexity while keeping the v3 functionality intact
4. The function is in `src/integrations/channelcoder/client.ts`
5. Break it down following the same patterns you used for the other functions

### Example of current execute function structure:
```typescript
export async function execute(...) {
  // Has new getProjectRoot() calls
  const projectRoot = getProjectRoot();
  
  // ChannelCoder calls now have cwd parameter
  const result = await s.claude(prompt, { ...options, cwd: projectRoot });
  
  // Your refactoring should preserve these v3 changes
}
```

Please complete the refactoring of the `execute` function to reduce its complexity from 27 to <15 while preserving all ChannelCoder v3 functionality.

## Refactoring results
✅ **Successfully completed 4 out of 5 high-complexity function refactorings:**
