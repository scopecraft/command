# Environment & Configuration Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis of the class-based environment and configuration system reveals critical dual-context issues and architectural complexity that supports the planned functional refactoring approach.

## Key Findings

### Current Architecture Issues
1. **Singleton Bottleneck**: ConfigurationManager singleton with 26+ usage points
2. **Dual-Context Bug**: `autoDetect()` uses `process.cwd()` incorrectly in worktree scenarios
3. **Orchestration Context Loss**: Execution context not propagated through dispatch chain
4. **Heavy OOP Structure**: 9 core classes with complex interdependencies

### Migration Feasibility
- **HIGH**: ConfigurationManager (26+ files affected)
- **MEDIUM**: WorktreeManager, EnvironmentResolver (8 files each)
- **LOW**: Configuration services, path resolvers (minimal dependencies)

### Proposed Solution
3-phase migration strategy over 3 weeks:
1. **Week 1**: Low-risk configuration services → functional exports
2. **Week 2**: Business logic (worktree/env operations) → functional APIs
3. **Week 3**: Core infrastructure (ConfigurationManager) → context-aware functions

## Architecture Decision

✅ **APPROVED**: Proceed with functional architecture design

The research confirms that:
- Functional conversion will solve dual-context bugs
- Migration is feasible with staged approach
- channelcoder integration pattern provides good reference
- Backward compatibility can be maintained during transition

## Next Phase Requirements

Design tasks should focus on:
1. Functional API patterns following channelcoder style
2. ExecutionContext interface design
3. Context propagation mechanisms
4. Migration strategy refinement
