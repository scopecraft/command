## Instruction
Review the Technical Requirements Document (TRD) against Scopecraft's architecture documentation and refine the design to ensure full alignment with architectural principles and future vision.

### Context

A comprehensive TRD was created for the functional API design to replace the class-based environment/configuration system. However, the design process may not have fully considered all architectural documentation in `/docs/02-architecture/`. This review ensures the TRD aligns with:

1. **Service Architecture** - Service boundaries, API design, future service extraction
2. **Orchestration Architecture** - Context propagation, session management, coordination patterns
3. **System Architecture** - Overall system design, component interactions, architectural principles
4. **Code Organization** - Module structure, dependency management, code layout standards

### TRD Location

**Document to Review**: `TRD-ExecutionContext-Functional-API-Design.md` in this parent task folder

### Review Requirements

#### 1. Architecture Alignment Review

Read and analyze these architecture documents:
- `/docs/02-architecture/service-architecture.md` - Check service boundary alignment
- `/docs/02-architecture/orchestration-architecture.md` - Verify orchestration patterns
- `/docs/02-architecture/system-architecture.md` - Ensure system-level compatibility
- `/docs/02-architecture/code-organization.md` - Validate module structure

#### 2. Gap Analysis

Identify any gaps or misalignments:
- Does ExecutionContext support all orchestration scenarios?
- Are service boundaries properly defined for future extraction?
- Does the API design follow established architectural patterns?
- Are there missing components or interfaces?
- Does context propagation align with orchestration architecture?

#### 3. Direct TRD Refinement

**IMPORTANT**: Edit the TRD document directly to:
- Add missing architectural considerations
- Refine interfaces based on architecture requirements
- Enhance service boundary definitions
- Improve orchestration context handling
- Add any missing integration points
- Ensure naming conventions match architectural standards

#### 4. Specific Areas to Review

**Service Boundaries**:
- Does the functional API design prepare for clean service extraction?
- Are dependencies properly isolated?
- Do interfaces support future gRPC/HTTP API exposure?

**Orchestration Patterns**:
- Does ExecutionContext fully support orchestration scenarios?
- Is parent→child context inheritance complete?
- Are session management patterns aligned?

**System Integration**:
- Does the design fit the overall system architecture?
- Are all integration points identified?
- Is the migration path realistic?

**Code Organization**:
- Does the proposed module structure follow standards?
- Are dependencies properly managed?
- Is the file organization optimal?

### Deliverable

1. **Updated TRD**: Direct edits to `TRD-ExecutionContext-Functional-API-Design.md`
2. **Summary of Changes**: Document what was changed and why in the Log section
3. **Architecture Compliance**: Confirm alignment with all architecture docs

### Success Criteria

- TRD fully aligns with architectural vision
- All service boundaries are properly defined
- Orchestration patterns are correctly implemented
- No architectural principles are violated
- Design supports future evolution as documented

- 2025-06-09: === AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION STARTED ===
- Task: 04_revi-agai-archtctre-desi-06B
- Analysis: Architecture review task (type:chore, area:architecture, tags:review/expertise:architect)
- Selected Mode: Design Mode (TRD review and refinement)
- Reasoning: Task involves reviewing and refining technical design documents against architecture
- Execution: Will review architecture docs, analyze TRD, and refine design directly
- 2025-06-09: Read all architecture documents:
- service-architecture.md: Service boundaries, pluggable design, Environment Service
- orchestration-architecture.md: Context propagation, session coordination
- system-architecture.md: Unix philosophy, pluggable architecture, progressive enhancement
- code-organization.md: Package structure, template system, storage patterns

Starting gap analysis between TRD and architecture docs...
- 2025-06-09: === EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
- Mode Used: Design Mode (TRD review and architecture alignment)
- Status: COMPLETED
- Deliverable: READY

**Architecture Review Summary:**
Analyzed TRD against all architecture documents and made comprehensive refinements:

**Major Enhancements Added:**
1. **Service Architecture Alignment**: Added service interfaces, dependency injection, pluggable storage adapters
2. **Orchestration Integration**: Enhanced ExecutionContext with workflow state, approval gates, session coordination
3. **Template System Integration**: Added mode loading, guidance integration, customization support
4. **Code Organization Compliance**: Updated module structure to follow core/interfaces/services pattern
5. **Storage Architecture**: Added hybrid storage model (runtime vs historical)

**Key Interface Additions:**
- Enhanced ExecutionContext with orchestrationState, sessionCoordination, templateContext, storageConfig
- New APIs: Orchestration Integration, Template Management, Storage Integration
- Service interfaces: EnvironmentService, ConfigurationService, OrchestrationService
- Progressive enhancement with capability detection

**Architecture Compliance Verified:**
✅ Service boundaries properly defined
✅ Unix philosophy maintained (composable functions)
✅ Progressive enhancement supported
✅ Template system integration
✅ Storage abstraction for local/cloud execution

TRD now fully aligns with Scopecraft's architecture vision while maintaining backward compatibility.
