## Description

Implement shell autocomplete support for the CLI commands to improve user experience and discoverability. This feature will allow users to press TAB to autocomplete command names, subcommands, and potentially options, making the CLI more efficient and user-friendly.

## Background & Analysis

Shell autocomplete is a standard feature in modern CLIs that significantly improves usability. Currently, users need to remember exact command names and structures, which can be challenging with the entity-command pattern. Autocomplete would make discovering and using commands much more intuitive.

Commander.js has some built-in support for generating shell completion scripts, but additional work is needed to make these scripts work well with our entity-command pattern and to support multiple shells, particularly fish shell.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Support for Multiple Shells**:
   - Primary: fish shell (priority based on maintainer's environment)
   - Secondary: bash/zsh (for broader compatibility)

2. **Autocomplete for**:
   - Entity names (task, phase, feature, area, workflow)
   - Command names for each entity (list, get, create, etc.)
   - Command arguments where appropriate (e.g. phase IDs for `phase update`)
   - Command options with descriptions

3. **Installation Mechanism**:
   - Automated installation during package setup
   - Manual installation command (`sc completion install`)
   - Documentation for manual setup

4. **Discovery Mechanism**:
   - Dynamic discovery of available phases, features, etc. for context-aware completion
   - Caching mechanism to avoid performance issues

## Technical Implementation Approach

1. **For fish shell**:
   - Create a dedicated completion file: `completions/sc.fish`
   - Use fish's `complete` command for defining completions
   - Implement dynamic completions using fish's command substitution
   
   ```fish
   # Example fish completion script
   complete -c sc -f
   
   # Entity types
   complete -c sc -n "__fish_use_subcommand" -a "task phase feature area workflow" -d "Entity type"
   
   # Task commands
   complete -c sc -n "__fish_seen_subcommand_from task" -a "list get create update delete" -d "Task command"
   
   # Dynamic phase completion example
   complete -c sc -n "__fish_seen_subcommand_from phase; and __fish_seen_subcommand_from update" -a "(sc phase list --format minimal)" -d "Phase ID"
   ```

2. **For bash/zsh**:
   - Leverage Commander.js's built-in completion generation
   - Create appropriate hooks for dynamic completions
   - Add installation scripts for `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

3. **Integration with Commander.js**:
   - Explore Commander's `program.createCompletion()` capability
   - Extend with custom completion logic for our specific needs
   - Generate completion scripts as part of the build process

4. **Dynamic Completion Data**:
   - Create efficient commands for fetching completion data
   - Implement caching to improve performance
   - Handle edge cases like empty repositories

## Tasks

- [ ] Research Commander.js's completion capabilities in detail
- [ ] Implement fish shell completion script
- [ ] Implement bash/zsh completion scripts
- [ ] Create completion installation command
- [ ] Add dynamic completion for phases, features, and areas
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for completion data
- [ ] Test completions in different shell environments
- [ ] Document completion features and installation process
- [ ] Add automated tests for completion script generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pressing TAB completes entity names (e.g., `sc t` ‚Üí `sc task`)
- Pressing TAB completes commands (e.g., `sc task l` ‚Üí `sc task list`)
- Pressing TAB after `phase update` shows a list of available phases
- Completion works efficiently without noticeable delay
- Installation process is documented and works reliably
- Completion scripts are automatically updated when CLI is updated
- Support for fish shell is complete and well-tested
- Basic support for bash/zsh is provided

## Notes

This is a more complex feature that requires careful testing across different shell environments. The implementation should prioritize fish shell support first (as it's the maintainer's primary environment) and then add bash/zsh support as a secondary goal.

The completion system should be designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements like completing task IDs or other dynamic data.
