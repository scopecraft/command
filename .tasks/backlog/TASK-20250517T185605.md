## Fix Biome Low-Risk Linting Issues

Replace forEach loops with for...of syntax as recommended by Biome linter.

### Affected Files:
- src/core/formatters.ts (multiple occurrences)
- Other files with forEach patterns

### Tasks:
- [ ] Replace `tasks.forEach()` with `for (const task of tasks)`
- [ ] Replace nested forEach loops with for...of
- [ ] Test to ensure no functional changes

### Risk Level: Low
Purely syntactic changes with no functional impact.
