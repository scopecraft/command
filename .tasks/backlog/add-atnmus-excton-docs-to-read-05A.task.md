## Instruction
Add a new section to the project's README.md explaining the autonomous execution system. This documentation should help developers understand when and how to use autonomous task execution.

**Requirements:**
1. Add section titled "Autonomous Task Execution" after the "Development" section
2. Explain what autonomous execution is (AI executing tasks without interaction)
3. Document how to run it using the `./implement-auto` command
4. Explain when to use autonomous vs interactive mode
5. Provide 2-3 example commands
6. Mention that all progress is documented in the task file itself
7. Keep it concise but informative (about 20-30 lines)

**Note**: This is a TEST task for validating the autonomous execution system. The goal is to see if the AI can successfully read, edit, and document its work autonomously.

## Tasks
- [x] Read the current README.md file
- [x] Find the appropriate location (after "Development" section)
- [x] Write the new documentation section
- [ ] Edit the README.md file to add the section
- [ ] Update this task with completion status
- [ ] Document all decisions and actions in the Log section

## Deliverable
A new "Autonomous Task Execution" section added to README.md with clear documentation on using the system.

## Log
- 2025-05-30: Task created for testing autonomous execution system
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:23: === AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION STARTED ===
  - Task: add-atnmus-excton-docs-to-read-05A
  - Area: core
  - Team: backend
  - Mode: Autonomous (no user interaction)
  - Objective: Add documentation for autonomous execution to README.md
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:24: Read the current README.md file
  - File contains 314 lines
  - Found main sections: Installation, Project Root Configuration, Quick Start, Entity-Command Pattern, Claude Commands, MCP Server Usage, Documentation, Integration Options
  - No "Development" section found - need to determine appropriate location
  - DECISION: Place new section after "Claude Commands" section
    - Context: Claude commands are part of the interactive development workflow
    - Options considered: After MCP Server Usage, After Documentation, New top-level section
    - Chosen because: Autonomous execution is a development workflow feature related to Claude commands
    - Impact: Logical flow from interactive (Claude) to autonomous execution
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:25: Writing the new documentation section
  - Section title: "Autonomous Task Execution"
  - Placement: After line 253 (end of Claude Commands section)
  - Content structure: Introduction, When to Use, How to Run, Examples, Key Points
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:26: BLOCKED: Cannot edit README.md file
  - Need: Edit/MultiEdit tool permissions
  - Tried: Both Edit and MultiEdit tools
  - Error: "Claude requested permissions to use [tool], but you haven't granted it yet"
  - Impact: Cannot complete the primary task objective
  - Workaround: None available - file editing is essential
  - Next steps: Task requires human intervention to grant permissions or manually apply changes
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:32: Continuing autonomous execution
  - Read README.md successfully (314 lines)
  - Confirmed placement location: After Claude Commands section (line 253)
  - Preparing documentation content for autonomous execution section
- 2025-05-30: 2025-05-30 14:35: Researched autonomous execution implementation
  - Found implement-auto wrapper script at project root
  - Located TypeScript implementation at scripts/implement-autonomous.ts
  - Discovered streaming capability using channelcoder SDK
  - Supports both single task and parallel execution
  - Logs are saved to .autonomous-tasks/logs/
  - DECISION: Documentation will explain practical usage
    - Context: Users need to understand when/how to use autonomous mode
    - Options considered: Technical focus vs practical focus
    - Chosen because: Practical examples help developers adopt the feature
    - Impact: Better developer experience and adoption
