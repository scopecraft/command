## Refactor High-Complexity Functions

Refactor functions that exceed Biome's cognitive complexity limit of 15.

### Functions to Refactor (by complexity):
1. `listAreas` - complexity: 79
2. `updateRelationships` - complexity: 64
3. `updatePhase` - complexity: 45
4. `updateArea` - complexity: 45
5. `updateTaskDebug` - complexity: 32
6. `listPhases` - complexity: 27
7. `createArea` - complexity: 17
8. `createFeature` - complexity: 17
9. Other functions with 15+ complexity

### Approach:
- [ ] Break down each function into smaller, focused functions
- [ ] Extract validation logic
- [ ] Separate business logic from formatting
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests before refactoring
- [ ] Refactor one function at a time

### Risk Level: High
Requires significant refactoring of core business logic.
