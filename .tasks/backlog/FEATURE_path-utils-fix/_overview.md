# Fix: Path Parsing and Directory Structure Refactoring

## Problem Statement
The current path parsing logic in `projectConfig.parseTaskPath()` fails when using relative root paths (e.g., `./e2e_test/worktree-test`), causing incorrect subdirectory extraction and breaking phase filters. Additionally, the v0.10.0 refactor introduced unnecessary complexity with a "phases" directory concept that doesn't match the actual directory structure.

## Solution (from PRD)
Based on the detailed PRD analysis:
1. Always resolve to absolute paths before parsing
2. Remove the unnecessary phases directory concept  
3. Migrate system directories to dot-prefix convention (.config, .templates)
4. Simplify the codebase by removing special case handling

## Implementation Approach

This fix is implemented in two comprehensive tasks that preserve context:

### Task 1: Core Implementation
- Remove phases directory references
- Enhance directory-utils.ts with absolute path logic
- Update all consumers to use centralized utilities
- Implement migration functionality
- Update documentation inline

### Task 2: Comprehensive Testing
- Create E2E tests (no mocking)
- Update all existing tests
- Perform integration testing
- Validate cross-platform compatibility
- Document results

## Success Criteria
- Path operations work correctly with relative root paths
- Phase filters function properly
- System directories migrated to .config and .templates
- All tests pass
- No performance degradation
