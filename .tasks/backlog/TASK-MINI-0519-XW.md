# Task UI - Minimize sections in the sidebar

## Overview
Add the ability to collapse/expand sidebar sections (Views, Phases, Features, Areas) to optimize screen space and improve navigation in the Tasks UI.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. ‚úÖ Add collapse/expand toggle buttons to each sidebar section header
2. ‚úÖ Save the expanded/collapsed state of each section to user preferences in localStorage
3. ‚úÖ Persist the state between sessions
4. ‚úÖ Include section title in the header even when collapsed
5. ‚úÖ Implement instant toggle functionality (animation removed due to layout issues)
6. ‚úÖ Add keyboard shortcuts for collapsing/expanding sections

### Technical Requirements
- ‚úÖ Maintain accessibility with aria-expanded attributes and keyboard navigation
- ‚úÖ Minimize re-renders when toggling sections
- ‚úÖ Ensure collapsed state is not reset when data changes (phases, features, areas)
- ‚úÖ Update UI layout calculations on collapse/expand to prevent layout shifts

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-20: Feature Implemented

#### 1. Updated data model
- Enhanced UIState interface to include collapsedSections object
```typescript
collapsedSections: {
  views?: boolean;
  phases?: boolean;
  features?: boolean;
  areas?: boolean;
};
```
- Added toggle functionality in UIContext with `toggleSectionCollapsed` function
- Configured localStorage persistence for section collapse state
- Set default state for all sections to expanded (false)

#### 2. Created UI components
- Implemented SectionHeader component with accessibility attributes
  - Used semantic HTML button for toggle control
  - Created consistent header design across all sections
  - Maintained section title visibility even when collapsed
- Added ChevronDown/ChevronRight icons for visual indication
- Implemented responsive layout for all screen sizes

#### 3. Added keyboard accessibility
- Implemented proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls)
- Used semantic button element for toggle controls
- Added Alt+Number keyboard shortcuts:
  - Alt+1: Toggle Views section
  - Alt+2: Toggle Phases section
  - Alt+3: Toggle Features section
  - Alt+4: Toggle Areas section

#### 4. Refined implementation
- Removed CSS transitions after discovering layout shifting issues
- Maintained section headers and "+ Create" buttons in collapsed state
- Used CSS classes for instant toggling with clean state changes
- Applied overflow handling to prevent layout issues

#### Files modified:
- `tasks-ui/src/lib/types/index.ts`: Updated UIState interface
- `tasks-ui/src/context/UIContext.tsx`: Added toggle functionality and localStorage persistence
- `tasks-ui/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`: Implemented collapsible sections with SectionHeader component

### 2025-05-20: Follow-up Bug Fix
- Fixed a critical HTML structure issue where a closing div tag was incorrectly used instead of a button tag
- Removed animation transitions that were causing subtle layout shifts when expanding sections
- Validated all changes with TypeScript checking

## UI/UX Design

### User Flow
1. ‚úÖ User clicks on the toggle icon in a section header to collapse/expand that section
2. ‚úÖ The section content instantly collapses/expands (animations removed to prevent layout issues)
3. ‚úÖ The toggle icon changes to indicate the current state (right chevron when collapsed, down when expanded)
4. ‚úÖ The section remains collapsed/expanded when navigating between views

### Key Components
- **Section Header**: Contains title and toggle button
- **Toggle Button**: Icon that changes based on state (chevron pointing down when expanded, right when collapsed)
- **Section Content**: The collapsible portion that hides/shows

## Technical Design

### Components Affected
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Enhanced with collapsible section functionality
  - Created SectionHeader component for consistent header UI
  - Applied proper className toggling based on section state
  - Implemented keyboard event listeners for shortcuts
- **UIContext.tsx**: Added state tracking and toggle function
  - Added toggleSectionCollapsed function to context
  - Enhanced localStorage persistence to save section states
- **types/index.ts**: Updated UIState interface with collapsedSections property

### Data Model Changes
Updated the UIState interface to include collapsed sections:

```typescript
export interface UIState {
  sidebarOpen: boolean;
  darkMode: boolean;
  activeView: 'home' | 'list' | 'detail' | 'form' | 'create' | 'graph';
  activeTaskId: string | null;
  toasts: Toast[];
  collapsedSections: {
    views?: boolean;
    phases?: boolean;
    features?: boolean;
    areas?: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Testing Performed

‚úÖ **Functionality Testing**
- Verified that clicking on section headers correctly toggles section visibility
- Confirmed that keyboard shortcuts (Alt+1 through Alt+4) toggle the appropriate sections
- Verified proper visual indication with chevron icons changing direction
- Ensured section headers remain visible when collapsed

‚úÖ **Persistence Testing**
- Validated that collapsed state persists when refreshing the browser
- Confirmed that localStorage correctly saves section collapse preferences
- Verified that state remains consistent across navigation changes

‚úÖ **Technical Testing**
- Fixed HTML structure issues with proper closing tags
- Verified TypeScript typechecking passes with no errors
- Fixed animation issues by removing transitions that caused layout shifts
- Ensured accessibility through proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## Task Breakdown Review

### UI Tasks
- [x] Update UIContext with collapsible sections state
- [x] Create SectionHeader component in Sidebar.tsx
- [x] Implement toggle button with visual indication
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for collapsing/expanding sections

### Core Tasks 
- [x] Implement localStorage persistence of collapsed state

### Test Tasks
- [x] Test collapsed state persistence
- [x] Test UI interactions
- [x] Test keyboard accessibility

## Human Review Required

### Technical decisions made:
- [x] Used existing lucide-react icons library for chevron icons
- [x] Implemented SectionHeader component within Sidebar.tsx rather than as a separate component file
- [x] Removed animations due to layout shifting issues
- [x] Selected Alt+Number keyboard shortcuts for consistency

### Design decisions made:
- [x] Maintained section headers visible at all times for discoverability
- [x] Used chevron direction to indicate expanded/collapsed state
- [x] Preserved "+ Create" buttons within headers even when sections are collapsed
- [x] Applied clean transitions without animations to prevent layout issues
