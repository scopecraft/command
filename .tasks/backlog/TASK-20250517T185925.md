## Implement Code Quality Enforcement for Claude Code

Create a multi-layered approach to ensure code quality when developing with Claude Code.

### Problem Statement
When developing with Claude Code, typecheck and Biome feedback often gets forgotten despite claude.md reminders. Need automated enforcement mechanisms.

### Implementation Log

#### âœ… Created `code-check` Script
- Created `scripts/code-check.ts` (initially named `claude-check.ts`, renamed for clarity)
- Features implemented:
  - Auto-detects whether to check staged or changed files
  - Supports `--staged`, `--changed`, `--all` flags  
  - JSON output with `--format=json`
  - Uses Biome's native VCS integration
  - Always runs full TypeScript check for safety
  - Uses Bun's streaming API for process output
  - Proper exit codes for orchestrator integration

#### âœ… Updated Biome Configuration
- Added VCS configuration to `biome.json`:
  ```json
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true,
    "defaultBranch": "main"
  }
  ```

#### âœ… Updated Package Scripts
- Added to root `package.json`:
  ```json
  "code-check": "bun scripts/code-check.ts",
  "check:staged": "biome check --staged",
  "check:changed": "biome check --changed"
  ```
- Updated `tasks-ui/package.json` build scripts to use `code-check`

#### âœ… Created Documentation
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with mandatory check instructions
- Created comprehensive `docs/code-quality.md` guide
- Updated `README.md` with code quality section

### Remaining Tasks

#### 5. Specialized Code Review Command
Create a dedicated command for code review:

```bash
scopecraft code-review [file|directory]
```

Features:
- Run TypeScript type check
- Run Biome linting
- Generate a comprehensive report
- Provide AI-friendly output for Claude
- Include commit-ready status

### Current Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect mode (default)
bun run code-check

# Specific modes
bun run code-check --staged
bun run code-check --changed  
bun run code-check --all

# JSON output for tooling
bun run code-check --format=json
```

### Benefits Achieved
1. âœ… Catches errors before they reach the repository
2. âœ… Provides immediate feedback during development
3. âœ… Works seamlessly with Claude Code workflow
4. âœ… Orchestrator-ready with JSON output and proper exit codes
5. âœ… Clear reporting for AI assistant context

### Notes
- Removed git hook requirement (can be added later if needed)
- Removed CI integration (no CI currently in place)
- Script renamed from `claude-check` to `code-check` for broader applicability
- Uses Bun's native APIs for better performance
