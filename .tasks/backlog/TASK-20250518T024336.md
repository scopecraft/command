# Proposal: Command Discovery and Contextual Execution System

## Brainstorming Summary

### Problem Statement
Currently, users must manually copy context (task IDs, feature details) when launching AI commands, and there's no centralized way to discover or execute available commands across different clients (CLI, MCP, UI). This creates friction in the workflow and prevents future orchestration capabilities.

### Recommended Solution
Create a minimal command discovery system in core that allows clients to list and execute Claude commands with pre-filled context. Each client handles execution in their own way while core provides the discovery infrastructure.

### Why This Approach
- Keeps core minimal and focused
- Allows client-specific execution patterns
- Enables future orchestration features
- Works with existing Claude command format ($ARGUMENTS)
- Leverages existing UI POC patterns

### Technical Considerations
- Command manifest for metadata (displayName, interactive/autonomous support)
- Simple discovery API in core
- Convention-based or manifest-based discovery
- Context passed as simple strings or objects based on client needs
- No changes needed to existing command format

### Estimated Effort
2-3 days including:
- Core API implementation
- Basic manifest structure
- Initial client integrations
- Testing

### Human Review Required
- [ ] Assumption: Commands will continue using $ARGUMENTS replacement pattern
- [ ] Derived conclusion: Manifest-based approach is preferred over directory scanning
- [ ] Pattern-based suggestion: Each client should handle execution differently

### Next Step
Use `/project:02_feature-proposal` with this summary to create a formal proposal.
