## Instruction

The Claude assistant feature has been integrated into V2 UI with frontend components, but the backend WebSocket/API integration is currently semi-broken and needs comprehensive review. The entire backend architecture should be evaluated and fixed to ensure proper Claude integration.

## Current Issues
- WebSocket connections may not be working properly
- Claude API integration needs verification
- Session management requires review
- Message handling and streaming functionality needs testing
- Error handling and reconnection logic needs validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WebSocket connection to Claude API is functional
- [ ] Message sending and receiving works end-to-end
- [ ] Session persistence and management is working
- [ ] Error handling and reconnection logic is robust
- [ ] API endpoints for Claude sessions are properly implemented
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all Claude functionality

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit current WebSocket implementation in `useClaudeWebSocket.ts`
- [ ] Review and test Claude API integration in backend
- [ ] Verify session management and persistence
- [ ] Test message streaming and real-time updates
- [ ] Fix any connection, authentication, or API issues
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow from UI to Claude API
- [ ] Document the fixed architecture and known limitations

## Deliverable

Fully functional Claude assistant integration with:
- Working WebSocket connections
- Reliable message sending/receiving
- Proper session management
- Robust error handling
- Documentation of the working system
