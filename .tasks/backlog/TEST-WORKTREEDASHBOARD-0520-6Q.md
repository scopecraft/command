# Worktree Dashboard Testing and Documentation

This task covers the implementation of comprehensive tests and documentation for the Worktree Dashboard feature to ensure quality, maintainability, and usability.

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Create unit tests for WorktreeCard component
- Create unit tests for WorktreeDashboard component
- Create unit tests for task-correlation-service
- Create unit tests for worktree-service
- Create unit tests for worktree-client
- Test edge cases (empty worktrees, errors, missing metadata)

### Integration Tests
- Test dashboard integration with task metadata
- Test feature vs. task detection and navigation
- Test auto-refresh functionality
- Test error handling and recovery

### E2E Tests
- Set up E2E test environment with actual git worktrees
- Create test scenarios for common workflows
- Test performance with larger numbers of worktrees

## Documentation Requirements

### User Documentation
- Create user guide for the Worktree Dashboard
- Document configuration options and preferences
- Include examples and screenshots

### Developer Documentation
- Document API endpoints and parameters
- Create technical documentation for the worktree service
- Add TypeDoc comments to public functions and interfaces
- Document integration points with the rest of the application

### Code Cleanup
- Address TypeScript errors in task-correlation-service
- Fix excessive cognitive complexity warnings
- Ensure consistent error handling approach
- Remove or replace console.log statements with proper logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests implemented with good coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify key functionality
- [ ] E2E tests confirm real-world behavior
- [ ] User documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Developer documentation covers APIs and integration
- [ ] TypeScript errors and linting issues resolved
- [ ] Code passes all quality checks
