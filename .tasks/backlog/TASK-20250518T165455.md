Quick fix to render markdown properly in entity descriptions when viewing features within phases. Currently, feature descriptions show as raw markdown text instead of being rendered.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Import ReactMarkdown and necessary plugins in EntityGroupSection.tsx
- [x] Replace plain text rendering with ReactMarkdown component
- [x] Apply the same markdown configuration as TaskContent.tsx
- [x] Ensure proper styling with prose classes

## Code Changes
1. Add imports:
   - import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
   - import rehypeRaw from 'rehype-raw'
   - import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

2. Update description rendering:
   - Replace `<p>{childEntity.description}</p>`
   - With ReactMarkdown component using same plugins

3. Apply proper Tailwind prose classes for styling

## Files to Modify
- tasks-ui/src/components/entity-group/EntityGroupSection.tsx

## Testing
- View a feature with markdown description from phase view
- Verify markdown elements render properly (lists, bold, links, etc.)
- Check dark mode compatibility

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-18
- Added ReactMarkdown imports to EntityGroupSection.tsx
- Updated entity description rendering to use ReactMarkdown with the same plugins as TaskContent.tsx (remarkGfm and rehypeRaw)
- Applied proper Tailwind prose classes for styling consistency
- Also updated the overviewContent rendering to use ReactMarkdown for consistency
- The packages were already installed in the project, so no new dependencies were needed

## Human Review Needed

Implementation decisions to verify:
- [x] Applied the same markdown plugins as TaskContent.tsx for consistency
- [x] Used the same prose styling classes for consistency across the UI
- [x] Updated both description and overviewContent for full markdown support

Technical assumptions:
- [x] ReactMarkdown configuration matches the rest of the app
- [x] Prose styling classes maintain the UI aesthetic
