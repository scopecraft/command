## Instruction
Fix the theme color issues in the delete task confirmation dialog buttons. Currently, the destructive button variant uses hard-coded `text-white` which causes white-on-white text in light mode, making buttons nearly invisible.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update Button component destructive variant to use `text-destructive-foreground` instead of `text-white`
- [ ] Verify all other button variants use theme-aware colors
- [ ] Test delete confirmation dialog in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Test other uses of destructive buttons throughout the app
- [ ] Check if focus states also need theme adjustments

## Deliverable
Updated Button component with proper theme support that ensures all button variants are visible and properly styled in both light and dark modes. The delete confirmation dialog should have:
- Cancel button: visible with proper outline styling
- Delete button: visible with proper destructive/CTA styling
- Both buttons respect theme colors and have good contrast

## Problem analysis
- The Button component's destructive variant uses `text-white` instead of theme-aware `text-destructive-foreground`
- The confirmation button (destructive variant) is almost invisible in light mode
- The cancel button (outline variant) works correctly as it uses theme-aware colors

## Solution
Update the Button component to use theme-aware color classes for all variants.
