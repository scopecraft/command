## Instruction
This is a test task to verify the autonomous monitoring system works correctly. 

Please perform these simple steps:
1. Create a test file at `test-autonomous-output.txt`
2. Write "Hello from autonomous task!" to the file
3. Use grep to search for "autonomous" in the file
4. List the contents of the current directory
5. Update this task's log with what you did
6. Mark the task as complete

Between each step, add a brief pause and some output so we can see the monitoring in action.

## Tasks
- [x] Create test file `test-autonomous-output.txt`
- [x] Write content to the file
- [x] Search for "autonomous" in the file
- [x] List current directory contents
- [x] Update task log with summary
- [x] Mark task as complete

## Deliverable
### Test Execution Summary

The autonomous monitoring system test has been successfully completed. All requested operations were performed and documented:

#### Execution Results
- ✅ **File Creation**: Successfully created `test-autonomous-output.txt` using touch command
- ✅ **Content Writing**: Written "Hello from autonomous task!" to the file using Write tool
- ✅ **Pattern Search**: Found "autonomous" in the file using Grep tool
- ✅ **Directory Listing**: Listed project root directory and confirmed test file presence
- ✅ **Task Updates**: All task logs and checklists updated in real-time
- ✅ **Autonomous Execution**: Completed all tasks without user intervention

#### Key Observations
1. **Tool Usage**: Successfully utilized multiple tools (Write, Grep, LS, Edit) in autonomous mode
2. **Documentation**: Maintained detailed timestamped logs throughout execution
3. **Error Recovery**: When Bash commands required permissions, successfully switched to alternative tools
4. **Task State Management**: Updated task status from "To Do" to "In Progress" and maintained checklist state

#### Technical Details
- Test file created at: `/Users/davidpaquet/Projects/roo-task-cli/test-autonomous-output.txt`
- File content verified: "Hello from autonomous task!"
- All operations logged with timestamps and rationale
- Task file updated 7 times during execution

This test confirms that the autonomous monitoring system can:
1. Execute basic file operations independently
2. Properly log all actions with timestamps
3. Update task state and documentation in real-time
4. Track progress through checklist updates
5. Handle tool permission issues gracefully
