# Feature: Worktree Dashboard for Tasks UI

## Problem Statement
Managing multiple parallel tasks through git worktrees is difficult without a centralized view of all active worktrees, their status, and metadata. Users need to constantly switch between terminals and UI to track their work.

## Proposed Solution
Create a worktree dashboard as the main home screen in Tasks UI that displays all active git worktrees with their associated task metadata, git status, and activity information in a card-based responsive layout.

## User Story
As a developer working on multiple tasks simultaneously using git worktrees, I want a centralized dashboard that shows the status of all my active worktrees so I can efficiently monitor and switch between them without excessive context switching.

## Goals
- Provide a comprehensive view of all active git worktrees
- Display relevant task metadata and git status information
- Enable quick navigation between worktrees and tasks
- Automatically refresh status at regular intervals
- Support responsive design for various screen sizes

## Non-Goals
- Implementing full git worktree management (create, delete)
- Supporting non-git project management
- Displaying task content or detailed git history
- Acting as a full git client

## Technical Breakdown

### Research/Spike Tasks
- Research git worktree operations with simplegit
- Explore API design for secure git operations
- Research efficient status polling strategies

### Area: UI
- Design WorktreeDashboard component layout and structure
- Implement WorktreeCard component with status visualization
- Create responsive grid layout for worktree cards
- Add configuration UI for dashboard settings

### Area: Core
- Implement WorktreeService for git operations
- Create data models for worktree information
- Build caching and polling infrastructure
- Develop APIs for worktree discovery and status

### Area: Integration
- Connect worktree branches to task metadata
- Replace home view with dashboard
- Implement auto-refresh and error handling
- Add documentation for the feature

## Dependencies
- Relies on git worktree functionality in the local environment
- Requires task metadata APIs to display task information
- Needs simplegit package for git operations

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Performance Impact**: Cache git operations and implement throttling
- **Git Version Differences**: Test with multiple git versions
- **File System Access**: Use secure API endpoints instead of direct access
- **Browser Security**: Implement proper validation and error handling

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard displays all active worktrees with correct status
- Users can quickly identify worktrees with uncommitted changes
- Auto-refresh provides up-to-date information
- Task metadata is correctly linked to worktree branches
- Interface is responsive and performant

## Human Review Required

Technical decisions needing verification:
- [ ] Component architecture and responsibilities
- [ ] Approach to git operations through API endpoints
- [ ] Data model design for worktree information
- [ ] Polling strategy and refresh intervals
- [ ] Security implementation for git operations

Design decisions to confirm:
- [ ] Card layout and information hierarchy
- [ ] Status visualization approach (colors, icons, labels)
- [ ] Dashboard organization and responsive behavior
- [ ] Error handling and empty state designs
- [ ] Interaction patterns for worktree management

Key assumptions to validate:
- [ ] Git worktree branches consistently correspond to task IDs
- [ ] The simplegit package provides all necessary git functionality
- [ ] Web UI can reliably access worktree directories via API
- [ ] Users typically work with fewer than 10 concurrent worktrees
- [ ] 30-second refresh interval balances responsiveness and performance
