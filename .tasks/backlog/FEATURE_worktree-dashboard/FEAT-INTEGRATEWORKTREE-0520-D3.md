# Integrate Worktree Dashboard Components with APIs

This task covers the integration of the previously developed visual Worktree Dashboard components with the real API endpoints that provide git worktree data.

## Requirements

### Component Integration
- Connect the WorktreeCard and WorktreeDashboard components to real data sources
- Implement data fetching and transformation from APIs to component props
- Add real-time refresh functionality (using appropriate polling/subscription pattern)
- Handle error states and edge cases with real API responses

### State Management Implementation
- Implement proper state management based on project patterns
- Add caching and persistence for worktree status data
- Optimize refresh cycles to minimize resource usage
- Implement loading and error states with real data

### Task Metadata Integration
- Connect worktree branch names with task metadata
- Implement proper linking between worktrees and task details
- Handle cases where branch names don't match task IDs

### Performance Optimization
- Implement throttling for API requests
- Add pagination or virtualization if needed for large numbers of worktrees
- Optimize rendering performance for status updates
- Implement efficient caching strategy

### User Preferences
- Add user configuration options for refresh interval
- Implement persistence of dashboard settings
- Add options to filter or sort worktrees

## Implementation Details

### API Client Updates
- Update `worktree-client.ts` to replace mock data with real API calls:
  - Uncomment and update the existing fetch code blocks in `fetchWorktrees()`
  - Uncomment and update the existing fetch code in `fetchWorktree()`
  - Update the `getWorktreeSummary()` function to use the API endpoint instead of calculating locally
  - Update the `getDashboardConfig()` and `saveDashboardConfig()` functions to use API endpoints

### Data Mapping
- Ensure API responses are correctly mapped to UI component props:
  - Map WorktreeStatus enum values correctly
  - Map WorkflowStatus enum values as expected by UI
  - Ensure timestamps are properly formatted for display
  - Handle null or undefined values gracefully

### Error Handling
- Implement specific error handling for each API endpoint
- Add retry logic or fallback behavior for critical API calls
- Display user-friendly error messages in the UI

### Testing Approach
- Test each API integration endpoint individually with the UI
- Verify data is displayed correctly in all component states
- Test refresh functionality with real Git changes
- Validate error states with simulated API failures

## Technical Approach
- Use the API interfaces designed in earlier tasks
- Follow project patterns for data fetching and state management
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## Dependencies
- Completed WorktreeCard and WorktreeDashboard visual components
- Implemented WorktreeService and API endpoints

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-22: Feature Complete

#### Feature/Task Detection and Navigation
- Fixed feature card detection using feature metadata presence
- Updated WorktreeCard component to check for presence of `featureProgress` data
- Made button text adapt to show "VIEW FEATURE" or "VIEW TASK" based on card type
- Implemented proper navigation to feature or task routes based on card type
- Fixed task correlation service to maintain original task IDs

### 2025-05-21: API Integration Started

#### API Client Updates
- Updated `worktree-client.ts` to use real API endpoints instead of mock data:
  - Implemented `fetchWorktrees()` to call the `/api/worktrees` endpoint with task metadata
  - Updated `fetchWorktree()` to call the `/api/worktrees/:worktreeId` endpoint
  - Modified `getWorktreeSummary()` to use the `/api/worktrees/summary` endpoint
  - Updated configuration methods to use the `/api/worktrees/config` endpoint with local storage fallback

#### Error Handling Implementation
- Added comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
- Added proper error message formatting and display
- Ensured local storage fallback for configuration persistence

#### Dashboard Component Updates
- Refactored the `WorktreeDashboard` component to handle real API data
- Extracted helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity
- Added refresh error handling and display
- Implemented configuration persistence through the API
- Added auto-refresh toggle functionality with server-side configuration

#### UI Testing
- Tested integration with all API endpoints
- Verified error state handling and display
- Confirmed auto-refresh functionality works correctly
- Validated configuration persistence between page reloads

## Remaining Tasks
- Add loading indicators during API calls
- Implement more detailed error messages for specific failure cases
- Add retry logic for failed API requests
- Implement pagination for large worktree lists
- Add sorting and filtering options for worktrees

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dashboard loads real worktree data from APIs
- [x] Status updates are correctly displayed when git changes occur
- [x] Task metadata is properly linked with worktree branches
- [x] Refresh functionality works with configurable intervals
- [x] Error handling gracefully manages API failures
- [x] Performance remains good with 10+ worktrees
- [x] All interactive elements (links, buttons) function properly
- [x] Dashboard correctly updates when worktrees are added/removed
- [x] Settings and preferences are properly persisted
- [x] Integration tests pass for all connected components
