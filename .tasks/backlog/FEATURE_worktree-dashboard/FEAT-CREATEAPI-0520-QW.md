# Create API Endpoints for Worktree Operations

This task involves creating the necessary API endpoints to expose git worktree operations to the Tasks UI dashboard.

## Requirements

### API Endpoints to Implement

1. **GET /api/worktrees**
   - Returns list of all worktrees with basic information
   - Parameters: None
   - Response: Array of worktree objects

2. **GET /api/worktrees/:worktreeId**
   - Returns detailed information for a specific worktree
   - Parameters: worktreeId (path or branch name)
   - Response: Detailed worktree object

3. **GET /api/worktrees/:worktreeId/status**
   - Returns git status for specific worktree
   - Parameters: worktreeId
   - Response: Git status object (changes, commits, etc.)

### Implementation Details

- Integrate with WorktreeService for git operations
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add security measures for input sanitization
- Implement response caching for performance
- Create API documentation

## Technical Approach

- Use existing API framework in the project
- Implement RESTful design patterns
- Add proper logging for debugging
- Create interface types for request/response objects

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all input parameters
- Validate worktree paths before operations
- Restrict operations to safe, read-only commands
- Add error boundaries around git operations

## Dependencies

- WorktreeService implementation (FEAT-IMPLEMENTWORKTREESERVICE-0520-88)
- Tasks UI API framework

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All API endpoints are implemented and functional
- [ ] Endpoints return correct data in expected format
- [ ] Error handling provides clear, actionable messages
- [ ] Security measures prevent injection or unsafe operations
- [ ] Performance is optimized with proper caching
- [ ] API is documented for frontend developers
- [ ] Endpoints are tested with appropriate test coverage
