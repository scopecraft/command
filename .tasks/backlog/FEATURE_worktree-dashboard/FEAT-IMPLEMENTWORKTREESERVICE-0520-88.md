# Implement WorktreeService for Git Operations

This task covers the implementation of the core service that will handle git worktree operations using simplegit.

## Requirements

### Worktree Discovery
- Implement functions to list all active git worktrees for a repository
- Extract path, branch name, and basic information
- Create utilities to match branch names with task IDs

### Git Status Monitoring
- Create functions to check git status (uncommitted changes)
- Implement last commit retrieval and parsing
- Add timestamp tracking for worktree activity

### Data Model Implementation
- Create the Worktree and WorktreeStatus interfaces
- Implement serialization/deserialization methods
- Add utility functions for data transformations

### Caching and Performance
- Implement caching strategy to minimize redundant operations
- Create throttling mechanisms for frequent status checks
- Add utilities for detecting significant changes only

## Technical Approach
- Use simplegit package for git operations
- Create a service class with clear interface
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use TypeScript for strong typing

## API Design
- `listWorktrees()`: Returns array of worktree objects
- `getWorktreeStatus(worktreePath)`: Returns detailed status
- `getLastCommit(worktreePath)`: Returns last commit info
- `getChangesCount(worktreePath)`: Returns count of uncommitted changes

## Dependencies
- simplegit package for git operations
- Task metadata API for task ID correlation

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-21: Implementation Complete

Implemented the following components:

1. **WorktreeService**: Core service implementing git worktree operations
   - Added `listWorktrees()` method to discover all worktrees
   - Implemented `getWorktreeStatus()` to check for changes
   - Created `getLastCommit()` to retrieve commit information
   - Added `getChangedFiles()` and `getChangesCount()` for file tracking
   - Implemented `extractTaskId()` for branch-to-task matching
   - Added `getWorktreeSummary()` for dashboard statistics

2. **TaskCorrelationService**: Service for connecting worktrees with task metadata
   - Implemented `correlateWorktreeWithTask()` to link worktrees with tasks
   - Added `correlateWorktreesWithTasks()` for batch operations
   - Created `getFeatureProgress()` to calculate feature completion
   - Implemented `extractModeFromTags()` to determine development mode

3. **CacheManager**: Performance optimization for git operations
   - Implemented time-based caching with configurable TTL
   - Added `getOrCompute()` method for lazy loading
   - Created cache invalidation methods

4. **Data Models**: Implemented using Zod schemas
   - Added `WorktreeSchema` for basic worktree information
   - Created `ChangedFileSchema` for tracking file changes
   - Implemented `FeatureProgressSchema` for feature completion tracking
   - Added enum types for `WorktreeStatus`, `WorkflowStatus`, and `DevelopmentMode`

5. **Utilities**:
   - Added error classes for domain-specific error handling
   - Implemented parsing helpers for git output

6. **Demo/Testing**:
   - Created `worktree-monitor.ts` script to demonstrate the service
   - Fixed script to properly run in Bun environment
   - Added detailed console output for worktree information

### Issues Resolved

- Fixed TypeScript module resolution by adding .js extensions to imports
- Fixed typings for simple-git library usage
- Resolved issue with WorktreeService.getLastCommit() by switching to raw git command
- Fixed worktree-monitor.ts script that was exiting immediately by implementing a never-resolving promise approach
- Implemented proper error handling for git operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] WorktreeService correctly discovers all active worktrees
- [x] Git status information is accurately retrieved
- [x] Branch names are properly correlated with task IDs when possible
- [x] Caching strategy prevents redundant operations
- [x] Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- [x] Performance is optimized for up to 10 concurrent worktrees
- [x] Code is well tested with monitor script
