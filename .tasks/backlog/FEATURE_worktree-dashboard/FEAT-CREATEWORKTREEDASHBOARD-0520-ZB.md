# Create WorktreeDashboard and WorktreeCard Components

This task covers the UI research, design, and implementation of the main components for the Worktree Dashboard feature, starting with purely visual components before integration.

## Research Phase (Completed)

### Codebase Exploration (Completed)
1. ‚úÖ Examined the existing Tasks UI component patterns and architecture
2. ‚úÖ Identified current state management approach (React hooks with context)
3. ‚úÖ Studied the styling and theming solutions (Tailwind CSS)
4. ‚úÖ Reviewed existing dashboard/grid components
5. ‚úÖ Understood how routing and navigation are implemented

### UX Research (Completed)
1. ‚úÖ Researched dashboard design patterns for monitoring tools
2. ‚úÖ Found inspiration from git GUIs and other monitoring dashboards
3. ‚úÖ Established information hierarchy for worktree information
4. ‚úÖ Implemented effective status visualization (dark color coding, icons)
5. ‚úÖ Selected responsive grid layout for desktop and mobile
6. ‚úÖ Implemented mobile-friendly dashboard patterns

## Design Approach (Completed)

### Information Architecture (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Identified critical worktree information to display (priority order):
  - Branch name and task ID association
  - Workflow status (To Start, WIP, Needs Attention, For Review, To Merge, Completed)
  - Git status (clean/changes/conflicts)
  - Last commit information
  - Recent activity timestamp
  - Associated task information
  - Development mode indicators

### Visual Design (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Created card layout with expandable sections
- ‚úÖ Designed status indicators with color-coding and icons
- ‚úÖ Implemented responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- ‚úÖ Added empty state, loading state, and error state designs
- ‚úÖ Created status summary with count indicators

## Implementation (In Progress)

### Purely Visual Components (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Created components with mock data to validate UI without API dependencies
- ‚úÖ Implemented WorktreeCard component with status variations
- ‚úÖ Built WorktreeDashboard layout with filtering capabilities
- ‚úÖ Added status visualizations and interactive elements
- ‚úÖ Implemented responsive behavior
- ‚úÖ Added auto-refresh functionality

### Component Props and Interface Design (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Designed clean component interfaces that are decoupled from data sources
- ‚úÖ Created adapters for transforming API data to component props
- ‚úÖ Implemented data providers that simulate real data patterns

### Visual Improvements (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Refined color scheme for status indicators (darker, more consistent palette)
- ‚úÖ Removed status summary badges to reduce visual noise
- ‚úÖ Enhanced FeatureProgress to show detailed task information rather than counts
- ‚úÖ Reorganized cards with ID/title at top, status in middle, git info at bottom
- ‚úÖ Added Last Activities section to dashboard header showing recent worktree activity
- ‚úÖ Improved git info layout with two-column design and timestamps
- ‚úÖ Improved responsiveness across screen sizes

## Dashboard Layout Improvements

### Last Activities Section
Added a "Last Activities" section to the dashboard header showing the 3 most recent worktree activities:

- Each activity shows:
  - Worktree/branch name
  - Activity type (files modified, commit, conflicts detected, etc.)
  - Time elapsed since activity (e.g., "2m ago")

- Activities are sorted by recency (most recent first)

- Different activity types are displayed based on worktree status:
  - Modified: "X files modified"
  - Conflict: "Merge conflicts detected"
  - Untracked: "New files added"
  - Clean: "Commit [hash]"

- This section improves the dashboard by:
  - Providing immediate context on recent project activity
  - Showing where active development is happening
  - Balancing the dashboard header layout

## Feature Progress Bar Enhancement

A significant improvement was made to the FeatureProgress component to show more useful information:

1. **Previous Implementation**:
   - When expanded, showed colored dot indicators with numeric counts
   - Example: "Completed: 2, In Progress: 1, To Do: 3, Blocked: 0"
   - Only provided summary data, not actionable information

2. **New Implementation**:
   - When expanded, shows the actual task list with titles and statuses
   - Each task shows truncated title (with tooltip) and status badge
   - Provides actionable information about which specific tasks are in each state
   - Makes better use of the available space

3. **Data Requirements**:
   - The `featureProgress` property now includes a `tasks` array with:
     ```typescript
     tasks?: {
       id: string;     // Task identifier
       title: string;  // Task title (will be truncated if too long)
       status: string; // Task status text
     }[];
     ```
   - When implementing the API integration, ensure this data is provided

## Technical Considerations (Completed)

### Data Flow Planning (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Designed data flow using React hooks and context
- ‚úÖ Created mock data service with simulated API responses
- ‚úÖ Implemented configurable auto-refresh strategy
- ‚úÖ Added single-worktree refresh capability

### Styling Approach (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Followed project's existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns
- ‚úÖ Created responsive styles for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ‚úÖ Implemented status color system with consistent palette:
  - To Start: slate-900
  - WIP: blue-950
  - Needs Attention: red-950
  - For Review: purple-950
  - To Merge: amber-950
  - Completed: green-950

## API Integration Considerations

The implementation has the following expectations for the API:

1. Workflow status enum values should be provided by the API:
   - TO_START ‚Üí displayed as "Start"
   - WIP ‚Üí displayed as "WIP"
   - NEEDS_ATTENTION ‚Üí displayed as "Attention"
   - FOR_REVIEW ‚Üí displayed as "Review"
   - TO_MERGE ‚Üí displayed as "Merge"
   - COMPLETED ‚Üí displayed as "Done"

2. Development mode indicators for different types of work:
   - TYPESCRIPT, UI, CLI, MCP, DEVOPS, CODEREVIEW, PLANNING, DOCUMENTATION

3. Worktree model should include:
   - path: string
   - branch: string
   - status: WorktreeStatus (CLEAN, MODIFIED, UNTRACKED, CONFLICT)
   - workflowStatus: WorkflowStatus
   - lastCommit: { hash: string, message: string, date: string }
   - lastActivity: Date (for timestamp display)
   - activity: { minutes: number }
   - mode?: { current: DevelopmentMode, next?: DevelopmentMode }
   - task?: { id: string, title: string, status: string }
   - featureProgress?: { 
       totalTasks: number, 
       completed: number, 
       inProgress: number, 
       blocked: number, 
       toDo: number,
       tasks?: { id: string, title: string, status: string }[]
     }
