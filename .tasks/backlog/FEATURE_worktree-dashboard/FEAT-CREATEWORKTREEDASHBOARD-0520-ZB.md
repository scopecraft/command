# Create WorktreeDashboard and WorktreeCard Components

This task covers the UI research, design, and implementation of the main components for the Worktree Dashboard feature, starting with purely visual components before integration.

## Research Phase

### Codebase Exploration
1. Examine the existing Tasks UI component patterns and architecture
2. Identify current state management approach (confirm if React Query is used)
3. Study the styling and theming solutions in the project
4. Review existing dashboard/grid components that might be reusable
5. Understand how routing and navigation are implemented

### UX Research
1. Research dashboard design patterns for monitoring tools
2. Look for inspiration from git GUIs and other monitoring dashboards
3. Consider information hierarchy - what data is most important to show
4. Research effective status visualization approaches (color coding, icons)
5. Consider various layouts (masonry, grid, list) and their pros/cons
6. Research mobile-friendly dashboard patterns

## Design Approach

### Information Architecture
- Identify critical worktree information to display (priority order):
  - Branch name and task ID association
  - Git status (clean/changes)
  - Last commit information
  - Recent activity

### Visual Design
- Create card layout sketches (can be code-based or conceptual)
- Design status indicators for different states
- Plan responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- Consider empty state and loading state designs

## Implementation

### Purely Visual Components First
- Create components with mock data to validate UI without API dependencies
- Implement static WorktreeCard component with all variations
- Build WorktreeDashboard layout with placeholder cards
- Add status visualizations and interactive elements
- Implement responsive behavior

### Component Props and Interface Design
- Design clean component interfaces that are decoupled from actual data sources
- Create adapters for transforming future API data to component props
- Implement mock data providers that simulate real data patterns

### Visual Testing
- Create storybook-style demonstrations of component variations
- Test across different screen sizes
- Validate color and status indicators for accessibility

## Technical Considerations

### Data Flow Planning
- Design data flow that will work with or without React Query
- Create mock data service to simulate API calls
- Plan refresh strategy that can be implemented later

### Styling Approach
- Follow project's existing styling patterns
- Create responsive styles that adapt to various screen sizes
- Implement status color system for different worktree states
