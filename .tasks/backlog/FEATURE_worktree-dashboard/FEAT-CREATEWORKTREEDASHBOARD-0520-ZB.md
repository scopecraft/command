# Create WorktreeDashboard and WorktreeCard Components

This task covers the UI research, design, and implementation of the main components for the Worktree Dashboard feature, starting with purely visual components before integration.

## Research Phase (Completed)

### Codebase Exploration (Completed)
1. ‚úÖ Examined the existing Tasks UI component patterns and architecture
2. ‚úÖ Identified current state management approach (React hooks with context)
3. ‚úÖ Studied the styling and theming solutions (Tailwind CSS)
4. ‚úÖ Reviewed existing dashboard/grid components
5. ‚úÖ Understood how routing and navigation are implemented

### UX Research (Completed)
1. ‚úÖ Researched dashboard design patterns for monitoring tools
2. ‚úÖ Found inspiration from git GUIs and other monitoring dashboards
3. ‚úÖ Established information hierarchy for worktree information
4. ‚úÖ Implemented effective status visualization (dark color coding, icons)
5. ‚úÖ Selected responsive grid layout for desktop and mobile
6. ‚úÖ Implemented mobile-friendly dashboard patterns

## Design Approach (Completed)

### Information Architecture (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Identified critical worktree information to display (priority order):
  - Branch name and task ID association
  - Workflow status (To Start, WIP, Needs Attention, For Review, To Merge, Completed)
  - Git status (clean/changes/conflicts)
  - Last commit information
  - Recent activity timestamp
  - Associated task information
  - Development mode indicators

### Visual Design (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Created card layout with expandable sections
- ‚úÖ Designed status indicators with color-coding and icons
- ‚úÖ Implemented responsive behavior for different screen sizes
- ‚úÖ Added empty state, loading state, and error state designs
- ‚úÖ Created status summary with count indicators

## Implementation (In Progress)

### Purely Visual Components (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Created components with mock data to validate UI without API dependencies
- ‚úÖ Implemented WorktreeCard component with status variations
- ‚úÖ Built WorktreeDashboard layout with filtering capabilities
- ‚úÖ Added status visualizations and interactive elements
- ‚úÖ Implemented responsive behavior
- ‚úÖ Added auto-refresh functionality

### Component Props and Interface Design (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Designed clean component interfaces that are decoupled from data sources
- ‚úÖ Created adapters for transforming API data to component props
- ‚úÖ Implemented data providers that simulate real data patterns

### Visual Improvements (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Refined color scheme for status indicators (darker, more consistent palette)
- ‚úÖ Added workflow status summary with counts
- ‚úÖ Shortened status labels for better display (TO_START ‚Üí Start, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Improved responsiveness across screen sizes

## Technical Considerations (Completed)

### Data Flow Planning (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Designed data flow using React hooks and context
- ‚úÖ Created mock data service with simulated API responses
- ‚úÖ Implemented configurable auto-refresh strategy
- ‚úÖ Added single-worktree refresh capability

### Styling Approach (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Followed project's existing Tailwind CSS styling patterns
- ‚úÖ Created responsive styles for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ‚úÖ Implemented status color system with consistent palette:
  - To Start: slate-900
  - WIP: blue-950
  - Needs Attention: red-950
  - For Review: purple-950
  - To Merge: amber-950
  - Completed: green-950

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Research phase completed with documented findings
- [x] Visual design approach documented with rationale
- [x] WorktreeCard component implemented with all status variations
- [x] Static WorktreeDashboard with mock data implemented
- [x] Responsive behavior works across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- [x] Component interfaces designed for easy integration with future API
- [x] Status visualization clearly communicates different states
- [x] Color scheme follows accessibility guidelines
- [x] Layout accommodates various numbers of worktrees (0, 1, 5, 10+)
- [x] Empty and loading states are implemented
- [x] Components follow existing Tasks UI patterns and standards

## Additional Features Implemented

- [x] Workflow status badging system with consistent colors and icons
- [x] Status summary with counts by workflow status
- [x] Filter system for workflow status and development mode
- [x] Configurable auto-refresh functionality
- [x] Individual worktree refresh capability
- [x] Error handling and retry mechanisms
- [x] Development mode visualization (TypeScript, UI, CLI, etc.)
- [x] Task association display with status indicators

## API Integration Considerations

The implementation has the following expectations for the API:

1. Workflow status enum values should be provided by the API:
   - TO_START ‚Üí displayed as "Start"
   - WIP ‚Üí displayed as "WIP"
   - NEEDS_ATTENTION ‚Üí displayed as "Attention"
   - FOR_REVIEW ‚Üí displayed as "Review"
   - TO_MERGE ‚Üí displayed as "Merge"
   - COMPLETED ‚Üí displayed as "Done"

2. Development mode indicators for different types of work:
   - TYPESCRIPT, UI, CLI, MCP, DEVOPS, CODEREVIEW, PLANNING, DOCUMENTATION

3. Worktree model should include:
   - path: string
   - branch: string
   - status: WorktreeStatus (CLEAN, MODIFIED, UNTRACKED, CONFLICT)
   - workflowStatus: WorkflowStatus
   - lastCommit: { hash: string, message: string, date: string }
   - activity: { minutes: number }
   - mode?: { current: DevelopmentMode, next?: DevelopmentMode }
   - task?: { id: string, title: string, status: string }
