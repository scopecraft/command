# Dashboard Integration and Testing

This task covers the integration of the Worktree Dashboard into the main Tasks UI application and comprehensive testing of the feature.

## Integration Requirements

### Home View Replacement
- Replace current home view with WorktreeDashboard component
- Update routing configuration to use dashboard
- Ensure proper navigation and linking between dashboard and task views

### Task Metadata Integration
- Connect worktree branches to task IDs
- Fetch and display task metadata in cards
- Handle missing or invalid task references gracefully

### Auto-Refresh Implementation
- Integrate polling mechanism for dashboard updates
- Implement user-configurable refresh intervals
- Optimize refresh strategy for performance

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Create unit tests for all components and services
- Test edge cases (empty worktrees, errors, etc.)
- Use mocks for git operations in tests

### Integration Tests
- Test dashboard integration with the main application
- Verify routing and navigation behavior
- Test task metadata integration

### E2E Tests
- Create end-to-end tests for the full feature
- Test with actual git repositories and worktrees
- Verify behavior across different scenarios

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Test with different numbers of worktrees (0, 1, 5, 10+)
- Verify responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Check status updates when git changes occur
- Test performance with frequent polling enabled

## Documentation Requirements

- Create user documentation for the feature
- Document API endpoints for developers
- Add comments and typedoc where appropriate

## Dependencies

- WorktreeDashboard component (FEAT-CREATEWORKTREEDASHBOARD-0520-ZB)
- WorktreeService implementation (FEAT-IMPLEMENTWORKTREESERVICE-0520-88)
- API endpoints (FEAT-CREATEAPI-0520-QW)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Dashboard is properly integrated into Tasks UI
- [x] Navigation between dashboard and tasks works correctly
- [x] Task metadata is correctly displayed in worktree cards
- [x] Auto-refresh works with configurable intervals
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests verify proper functionality
- [ ] E2E tests confirm real-world behavior
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [x] Feature works correctly across different scenarios

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- Dashboard integration with Tasks UI
- Worktree to task/feature metadata linking
- Auto-refresh implementation with configurable intervals
- Navigation between dashboard and tasks/features
- Feature/task detection and button labeling
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Remaining
- Unit tests for components and services
- Integration and E2E tests
- Feature documentation
- API endpoint documentation
