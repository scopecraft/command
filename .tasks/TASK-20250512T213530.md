# Implementation Phase 2: Core Task Management UI - React Task UI

## Overview
This task covers the actual implementation of the Core Task Management UI phase for the React Task UI application as defined in the Implementation Plan (TASK-20250512T143818). This is NOT a planning task but the actual coding implementation of the main task management interface.

  - Add `assigned_to` column (highest priority) âœ…
  - Add toggleable column visibility controls âœ…
  - Implement date formatting for date fields âœ…
  - Add visual indicators for tasks with dependencies âœ…
- [x] Implement advanced filtering, sorting, and search functionality
  - Add filters for status, type, priority, tags, and assignees âœ…
  - Improve filter UI with expanded filter view âœ…
  - Implement column sorting for all data fields âœ…

## Implementation Notes

### Changes Based on Phase 1 Implementation
- Phase 1 already implemented basic versions of TaskListView and TaskFormView; enhance rather than create from scratch
- Build upon the URL-based routing structure implemented with wouter
- Enhance the mock core library integration for better testing capabilities
- Leverage the existing context providers for state management

### Specific Improvements
- TaskListView: Replace simple table with TanStack Table for advanced functionality âœ…
- TaskListView: Add MDTM-compliant columns including `assigned_to` and toggleable visibility âœ…
- TaskListView: Add comprehensive filtering including assignee filtering âœ…
- TaskFormView: Add form validation, dynamic field generation, and better UX ðŸ”œ
- Routing: Add query parameter support for filtering and searching
- Template Handling: Implement dynamic form generation based on task templates
- State Management: Improve context providers for better performance

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain the terminal-inspired theme established in Phase 1
- Build on the existing component structure without major architectural changes
- Focus on enhancing existing functionality before adding new features
- Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
