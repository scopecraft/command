## Rename Project to Scopecraft Command

Rename the project from "Roo Task CLI" to "Scopecraft Command" as part of our rebranding initiative. This is a preemptive rename before the official repository creation and package publishing, so we're establishing the right branding from the start.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update all documentation files with new name "Scopecraft Command"
- [x] Rename CLI command references from `roo-task` to `scopecraft-command` (or a shorter alias like `sc`)
- [x] Rename MCP server command references from `roo-task-mcp` to `scopecraft-command-mcp` (or `sc-mcp`)
- [x] Update internal code references and imports

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks

### 1. Documentation Updates

- [x] Update README.md to reflect new name and command examples
- [x] Update ROADMAP.md with new product name
- [x] Update DEVELOPMENT.md with new command examples
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with updated commands and project name
- [x] Update all docs/ markdown files
- [x] Update examples/ files to use new command names
- [x] Update templates to reference new branding

### 2. Code Updates

- [x] Update package.json name field to "@scopecraft/command"
- [x] Update binary names in package.json to use new command names
- [x] Update imports and references in code to use new naming
- [x] Update any command output text that mentions the old name

### 3. Command Line Interface

- [x] Update CLI command strings in help text
- [x] Update any output text that refers to command names

### 4. Testing

- [x] Run existing test scripts (`bun run test`) to verify functionality
- [x] Run manual tests with `bun run dev:cli` using new command names
- [x] Verify MCP server functionality with new naming

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with documentation updates to ensure consistent messaging
2. Make code changes to reflect new command names
3. Run tests to ensure functionality remains intact
4. Prepare for initial repository creation with new branding

## Considerations

- Since the package hasn't been published yet, this is the perfect time to rebrand
- Choose concise command names that are easy to type but clear (e.g., `sc` instead of `scopecraft-command`)
- Ensure all internal help text and examples use the new command names

## Implementation Log
