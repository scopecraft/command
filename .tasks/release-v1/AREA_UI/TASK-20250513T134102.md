# Add Feature and Area Support to Task UI

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

The task management UI currently displays tasks in a flat list or by phase, but doesn't allow visualizing and navigating the hierarchical structure of features/areas. This task involves improving the UI to fully support the MDTM directory structure of features and areas, making it easier to work with organized task collections.

## Objectifs et Crit√®res d'Acceptation ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Hierarchical Visualization (High Priority)

  * - [x] Add a "Feature/Area" column in the task list
  * - [x] Allow sorting and filtering by feature/area
  * - [x] Visually distinguish features and areas (different icons)
  * - [x] Add a progress indicator for each feature/area

* - [x] **Detailed view for a specific Feature/Area**:
  * - [x] Create dedicated routes `/feature/:id` and `/area/:id`
  * - [x] Display header with title, description, and status
  * - [x] List all tasks belonging to this feature/area
  * - [x] Integrate a progress indicator (% of completed tasks)

  * - [x] Allow quick filtering by popular features/areas

* - [x] **Smart back-navigation**:
  * - [x] Preserve feature/area context during navigation
  * - [x] Intelligent return to filtered list after task editing

### Phase 3: Advanced Interactions (Low Priority)

  * - [x] Improved phase context preservation across the app

## Implementation Requirements üìù

### Required API

The user interface will consume the enhanced API endpoints developed in the related task "Enhance Feature and Area Support in CLI and MCP" (TASK-20250513T132917). Key endpoints include:

* Feature list endpoint (feature_list)
* Feature details endpoint (feature_get)
* Area list endpoint (area_list)
* Area details endpoint (area_get)
* Enhanced task list with hierarchical information
* Task movement endpoint for reorganization features

### Technical Approach

#### Modification of the DataTable
```tsx
// Extension de la DataTable existante
<DataTable 
  columns={columns} 
  data={filteredTasks}
  groupBy="subdirectory"  // New parameter to group by feature/area
  groupRenderer={(group) => (
    <FeatureAreaGroupHeader 
      name={group.name} 
      type={group.type} // "feature" or "area"
      taskCount={group.items.length}
      progress={calculateProgress(group.items)}
    />
  )}
/>
```

#### New Feature/Area Route
```tsx
// New components for dedicated display
<Route path="/feature/:id" component={FeatureView} />
<Route path="/area/:id" component={AreaView} />

// Composant FeatureView (similaire pour AreaView)
function FeatureView() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const { tasks } = useTaskContext();
  
  // Filter tasks belonging to this feature
  const featureTasks = tasks.filter(task => 
    task.subdirectory === `FEATURE_${id}`
  );
  
  return (
    <div>
      <FeatureHeader id={id} />
      <ProgressIndicator tasks={featureTasks} />
      <TaskListView tasks={featureTasks} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Extension of Existing Filter
```tsx
// Adding filters for features/areas
function FeatureAreaFilters({
  filters,
  onFilterChange,
  featureOptions,
  areaOptions
}) {
  // Filtering logic
  return (
    <div className="filter-section">
      <h3>Features</h3>
      {featureOptions.map(feature => (
        <FilterCheckbox
          key={feature}
          label={feature.replace('FEATURE_', '')}
          checked={filters.subdirectory === feature}
          onChange={() => handleFeatureChange(feature)}
        />
      ))}
      
      <h3>Areas</h3>
      {areaOptions.map(area => (
        <FilterCheckbox
          key={area}
          label={area.replace('AREA_', '')}
          checked={filters.subdirectory === area}
          onChange={() => handleAreaChange(area)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### UI Components to Develop

1. **Feature/Area Column**:
   - Display feature/area name in the task table
   - Visual badges with differentiation between features vs areas

2. **Group Header**:
   - Component for feature/area groups in the table
   - Progress bar and summary information

3. **Detail Page**:
   - Complete view for a specific feature or area
   - Overview content
   - Filtered task list
   - Progress metrics

4. **Enhanced Filters**:
   - Filter section dedicated to features/areas
   - Multi-selection and combination support

5. **Movement Interfaces**:
   - Dropdown lists for moving tasks
   - Batch selection mode

### Design Considerations

- Maintain consistency with the existing UI design language
- Ensure accessibility for all new UI components
- Optimize for desktop and mobile views
- Consider performance implications of displaying hierarchical data
- Use progressive disclosure to manage complexity
- Apply consistent color coding across all views

## Dependencies üîÑ

  - Comprehensive phase context throughout the application

## Evolution Plan: Multi-Phase Features/Areas üîÑ

### Problem Statement
Features and areas can exist across multiple phases, creating duplicates in the user interface. We want to treat them as unique entities at the UI level while preserving their phase association.

### Revised Approach

#### 1. UI-Layer Deduplication
- Keep features/areas separate by phase in the data layer
- Deduplicate only at the presentation layer (components, navigation, dropdowns)
- Show phase affiliation for each feature/area (e.g., "Authentication [v1, v2]")
- No need to modify API endpoints or formats

#### 2. Phase Context Preservation
- When viewing a specific feature/area, maintain its phase context
- Show a simple phase selector to switch between phases for the same feature
- Route properly to respect phase context in URLs

#### 3. Phase-Specific Metrics
- Display phase-specific metrics without complex aggregation
- No need to merge progress metrics across phases

#### 4. Phase-Grouped Display in Feature/Area View
- When viewing a specific feature/area, organize content by phase
- Each phase gets its own section with:
  - Phase-specific header (name, status)
  - Phase-specific progress metrics
  - Phase-specific task table

#### Visual Structure Example:
```
FEATURE: Authentication
[Phase selector: v1, v2, v3]

-- RELEASE v1 ------------------
Progress: 100% (8/8 tasks)
[Task Table for v1 tasks]

-- RELEASE v2 ------------------
Progress: 28% (2/7 tasks)
[Task Table for v2 tasks]

-- RELEASE v3 ------------------
Progress: 0% (0/5 tasks)
[Task Table for v3 tasks]
```

### Implementation Plan

**Step 1: UI Component Updates (Completed)**
- Modify feature/area listing components to group by name
- Add phase indicators in the UI (badges, labels, etc.)
- Implement a simple phase context switcher

**Step 2: Reusable Entity Grouping Components**
- Create a generic **EntityGroupSection** component that can handle bidirectional relationships:
  - Support displaying phases within features/areas
  - Support displaying features/areas within phases
  - Share common functionality for metrics, task lists, and collapsible sections
  - Adapt styling based on entity type
  - Handle specialized use cases like phase-specific overview documents
- Use this component for all entity relationship views:
  - Feature detail views showing phases
  - Area detail views showing phases
  - Future phase detail views showing features

**Step 3: Entity Relationship Views**
- Implement Feature and Area detail views using the EntityGroupSection
- Group tasks by their relationships in all views
- Display appropriate entity-specific metrics
- Implement collapsible sections for better space management

**Step 4: Navigation and Selection**
- Update dropdowns to show deduplicated items with phase information
- Ensure proper phase context is maintained when selecting an item
- Implement contextual navigation between entity types
