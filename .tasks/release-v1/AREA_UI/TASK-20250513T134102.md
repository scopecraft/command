# Add Feature and Area Support to Task UI

## Description ✍️

The task management UI currently displays tasks in a flat list or by phase but lacks support for visualizing and navigating the hierarchical feature/area structure. This task involves enhancing the UI to fully support the MDTM feature and area directory structure, making it easier to work with organized task collections.

The implementation should display the feature/area hierarchy, allow filtering and navigation by feature/area, and provide visual indicators of feature progress and status based on subtasks.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [ ] Display hierarchical feature/area/task structure in the task list view
  * - [ ] Show features and areas as collapsible groups
  * - [ ] Visually distinguish between features, areas, and tasks
  * - [ ] Show feature/area progress indicators
* - [ ] Add feature/area filters to the task list
  * - [ ] Filter by feature name
  * - [ ] Filter by area name
  * - [ ] Combined filters with other existing filters (phase, status, etc.)
* - [ ] Enhance task detail view
  * - [ ] Show feature/area context in task detail
  * - [ ] Add navigation links to parent feature/area
  * - [ ] Show related tasks within the same feature/area
* - [ ] Add feature management UI
  * - [ ] Feature creation form
  * - [ ] Feature editing form
  * - [ ] Feature overview display
* - [ ] Create feature dashboard view
  * - [ ] Visual representation of features and their progress
  * - [ ] Status indicators for features based on subtask status
  * - [ ] Timeline view for features across phases
* - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for task organization
  * - [ ] Move tasks between features/areas
  * - [ ] Reorder tasks within features/areas
* - [ ] Implement responsive design for all feature/area UI components

## Requirements for Implementation 📝

### Data Requirements

The UI will need to consume the enhanced API endpoints being developed in the related task "Enhance Feature and Area Support in CLI and MCP" (TASK-20250513T132917). Key data endpoints include:

* Feature listing endpoint (feature_list)
* Feature details endpoint (feature_get)
* Area listing endpoint (area_list)
* Area details endpoint (area_get) 
* Enhanced task listing with hierarchical information
* Task movement endpoint for drag-and-drop functionality

### UI Components to Develop

* **Feature/Area Tree View**: Hierarchical display of features, areas, and their tasks
* **Feature Dashboard**: Progress visualization for all features
* **Feature Detail View**: Overview of a specific feature with progress metrics
* **Feature Creation/Edit Form**: UI for managing features
* **Enhanced Task Filters**: UI controls for filtering by feature/area
* **Task Movement UI**: Drag-and-drop interface for reorganizing tasks

### Design Considerations

* Maintain consistency with existing UI design language
* Ensure accessibility for all new UI components
* Optimize for both desktop and mobile views
* Consider performance implications of hierarchical data display

## Dependencies 🔄

* Depends on backend implementation of feature/area support (TASK-20250513T132917)
* Requires API endpoints for:
  * Feature/area listing
  * Feature/area details
  * Task movement between features/areas
  * Hierarchical task listings

## Suggested Implementation Approach 💡

* **Phase 1**: Read-only visualization
  * Implement hierarchical display of existing features/areas
  * Add feature/area filtering capabilities
  * Enhance task detail view with feature context
  
* **Phase 2**: Feature management
  * Implement feature creation/editing forms
  * Add feature dashboard with progress visualization
  
* **Phase 3**: Interactive organization
  * Implement drag-and-drop task movement
  * Add bulk operations for task management

As the react-dev team, you have full autonomy on UI/UX design decisions while meeting the functional requirements outlined above. The backend APIs will follow the patterns established in existing endpoints, with additional parameters and return data for feature/area functionality.

## API Integration Examples 📊

```javascript
// Example API integration for feature listing
const fetchFeatures = async (phaseId) => {
  const response = await api.invoke('feature_list', { 
    phase: phaseId,
    include_progress: true 
  });
  return response.data;
};

// Example API integration for moving a task
const moveTaskToFeature = async (taskId, featureId) => {
  const response = await api.invoke('task_move', {
    id: taskId,
    to_feature: featureId
  });
  return response.success;
};
```

## Review Notes 👀

* Coordinate with backend developers working on the feature/area API endpoints
* Consider conducting user testing for the hierarchical display
* Plan for gradual rollout if the features are substantial UI changes
