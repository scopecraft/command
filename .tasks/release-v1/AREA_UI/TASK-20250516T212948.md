# Add Console Easter Eggs

I want a funny easter egg in the console of cli and console of the task ui. Here are some fun easter egg ideas:

## CLI Easter Eggs

1. **The Konami Code**: When typing the Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA), display a fun ASCII art banner with a message like "You found the secret! 🎮✨"

2. **Random Task Wisdom**: When running `task wisdom` or `task zen`, display a random funny/inspirational quote about task management:
   - "The best time to complete a task was yesterday. The second best time is now."
   - "Tasks are like cats - they multiply when you're not looking."
   - "May your tasks be few and your commits be many."

3. **Task Counter Celebrations**: 
   - When completing the 100th task: "🎉 Century club! You've conquered 100 tasks!"
   - When completing the 42nd task: "The answer to everything... including task #42!"
   - When completing the 404th task: "Task not found... just kidding! You found it and crushed it!"

4. **ASCII Art Task Mascot**: Hidden command `task mascot` shows a cute ASCII art character:
   ```
    ___
   (o o)
   ( > )  < I'm Tasky!
   /"V"\     Let's get things done!
   ```

5. **Loading Messages**: Random funny messages during long operations:
   - "Reticulating splines..."
   - "Teaching tasks to dance..."
   - "Convincing bits to align..."
   - "Bribing the CPU with extra cycles..."

## Task UI Easter Eggs

1. **Console Disco**: Type "disco" in the console to make the console text flash different colors briefly

2. **Matrix Mode**: Type "matrix" in the console to show falling green text matrix-style for a few seconds

3. **Task Confetti**: When marking a task complete with console commands, occasionally trigger confetti animation

4. **Hidden Credits**: Type "credits" to show a fun scrolling credits screen with team members as movie roles:
   - "Director of Task Chaos: You"
   - "Executive Producer of Procrastination: Also You"
   - "Special Thanks: Coffee ☕"

5. **Task Achievements**: Console notifications for milestones:
   ```
   console.log("🏆 Achievement Unlocked: Task Slayer - Complete 10 tasks in one day!");
   ```

6. **Secret Sound Effects**: Type "sound on" in console to enable subtle sound effects when completing tasks (8-bit victory sound)

7. **Console Pet**: Type "pet" to spawn a small ASCII pet that occasionally moves around in the console:
   ```
   (\_/)
   ( •.•)
   (")_(")
   ```

8. **Developer Dad Jokes**: Type "joke" for programming dad jokes:
   - "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!"
   - "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem!"

## Implementation Notes

- Easter eggs should be subtle and not interfere with normal usage
- Should be documented in a hidden EASTER_EGGS.md file for developers
- Add a config option to disable easter eggs for serious environments
- Consider seasonal easter eggs (different messages for holidays)

-- Classified as a Feature with low priority, added to UI Enhancements feature set. This is a fun developer experience enhancement that adds personality to the tool without impacting core functionality.
