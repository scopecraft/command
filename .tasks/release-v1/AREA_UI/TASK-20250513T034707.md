## Description

When accessing the task list directly via a URL with query parameters (e.g., `/tasks?phase=phase-1`), the filtering is not properly applied in the task table. The parameters are added to the URL but the UI doesn't reflect the filter selection in the filter controls, and the table doesn't filter the tasks.

This issue specifically affects direct URL access - clicking a phase in the sidebar works correctly because it explicitly sets the filters in the component state, but reloading the page or accessing via a direct link doesn't properly apply the filters.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Click on a phase in the sidebar (e.g., "Planning")
2. Observe that the task list is filtered correctly and the URL contains `?phase=phase-1`
3. Reload the page
4. Observe that the filter is not applied correctly - the URL contains the parameters, but the tasks are not filtered

## Expected Behavior

The task list should properly apply filters based on URL parameters when the page is loaded directly, ensuring that:
1. The filter UI controls reflect the active filters from URL parameters
2. The task table shows filtered results according to these parameters
3. The filter state is properly synchronized with URL parameters

## Implementation Notes

The issue is likely in the `TaskListView.tsx` component:
- The URL parameters are correctly read on component mount but aren't being properly applied to the actual filter UI
- Need to ensure that filter state is initialized from URL params and properly applied to the table
- The connection between URL parameters and actual filter application needs to be fixed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task list correctly applies filters from URL parameters on direct page load
- [ ] Filter UI controls reflect the active filters from URL parameters
- [ ] Reloading a filtered page maintains the correct filter state
- [ ] Direct links to filtered views (e.g., sharing a link) work correctly

## Related Issues
- This is related to the phase filtering functionality that was recently implemented
