# Task Worktree Features and Improvements

## Overview

The Task Worktree (tw) functionality allows developers to work on multiple tasks in parallel using git worktrees, each with its own isolated environment. This area focuses on enhancing and extending the task worktree functionality to improve developer experience and workflow efficiency.

## Current Capabilities

- Create isolated git worktrees for each task (`tw-start`)
- Launch Claude Code with task context in the worktree
- Remove worktrees when tasks are complete (`tw-finish`)
- List existing worktrees (`tw-list`)

## Planned Improvements

The following improvements are planned for the task worktree functionality:

1. **Pre-authorized Tools**: Add support for pre-authorizing specific tools when launching Claude in a task worktree
2. **Improved Directory Handling**: Ensure users remain in the task worktree directory after exiting Claude
3. **Code Review Command**: Add a `tw-review` command to facilitate code reviews of completed tasks
4. **Task Status Integration**: Better integration with task status updates and workflows
5. **Additional Worktree Shortcuts**: Create additional convenience commands for common worktree operations

## Implementation Strategy

Each improvement will be implemented as a separate task with clear acceptance criteria and testing plans. The implementation will focus on maintaining compatibility with existing workflows while adding new features incrementally.

## Benefits

These improvements will:
- Reduce repetitive authorization prompts, improving productivity
- Maintain better context when switching between tasks
- Improve code quality through systematic reviews
- Streamline the task workflow from start to finish
