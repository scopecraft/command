# Enhance Feature and Area Support in CLI and MCP

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

This task focuses on improving the support for MDTM feature and area directories within both the CLI and MCP interfaces. Currently, the system has basic support for subdirectories but lacks dedicated commands and proper handling of feature/area relationships, overview files, and hierarchical task management.

The implementation will enhance how features and areas are created, managed, and displayed, ensuring better compatibility with the MDTM specification while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface for users.

## Design Considerations üìä

### Code Organization

```
// Core implementation (src/core/task-manager.ts)
export async function listFeatures(options?: FeatureFilterOptions): Promise<OperationResult<Feature[]>> {
  // Implementation here
}

// CLI wrapper (src/cli/commands.ts)
export async function handleFeatureListCommand(options: FeatureListCommandOptions): Promise<void> {
  const result = await listFeatures(options);
  // Handle CLI output formatting
}

// MCP wrapper (src/mcp/handlers.ts)
export async function handleFeatureList(params: FeatureListParams): Promise<OperationResult<Feature[]>> {
  return await listFeatures(params);
}
```

### Feature Representation

```
Features will be represented in a hierarchical structure:

FEATURE_Authentication/
  _overview.md            (Feature metadata, description, subtasks)
  001_login_ui.md         (Task)
  002_login_logic.md      (Task)

Task listing with hierarchy:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication Feature
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Login UI
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Login Logic API Call
```

### Feature Status Calculation

```
Feature status will be calculated based on subtask status:

- Not Started: All subtasks are "To Do"
- In Progress: At least one subtask is "In Progress"
- Nearly Complete: >80% of subtasks are "Done", none are "Blocked"
- Blocked: At least one subtask is "Blocked"
- Complete: All subtasks are "Done"

Progress percentage = (# of completed tasks / total # of tasks) * 100
```

### Command Structure

```
Feature management commands:
sc feature create --name "Authentication" --description "User authentication features"
sc feature list [--format table|json] [--phase <phase>]
sc feature get <feature-id> [--format default|json]
sc feature update <feature-id> --name "New Name" --description "Updated description"
sc feature delete <feature-id> [--force]

Task movement:
sc task move <task-id> --to-feature <feature-id>
```

### MCP Tool Descriptions

```json
// Example MCP tool description for feature_list
{
  "name": "mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_list",
  "description": "List all features in the current project",
  "parameters": {
    "phase": "Optional phase to filter features by",
    "format": "Optional output format (json, table)",
    "include_tasks": "Include tasks within features in response (default: false)",
    "include_progress": "Include calculated progress metrics (default: true)"
  },
  "returns": "List of feature objects with metadata and optional task information",
  "example": {
    "method": "feature_list",
    "params": {
      "phase": "release-v1",
      "include_progress": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Review Notes üëÄ

* Consider usability in large projects with many features
* Ensure backward compatibility with existing task structure
* Verify proper handling of special characters in feature/area names
* Test with both CLI and MCP interfaces to ensure consistent behavior
* Review tool descriptions for clarity and completeness
* Look at existing patterns in the codebase for phase management as a reference

## Implementation Log üìù

- Added Feature and Area interfaces to core/types.ts to represent feature and area structures
- Added filter options and update options interfaces for consistent API behavior
- Implemented feature and area management core functions in task-manager.ts
- Added moveTask function for task relocation between features/areas
- Fixed async function issues in listFeatures and listAreas
- Created CLI commands for feature and area management in entity-commands.ts
- Added handlers for feature and area MCP methods in handlers.ts
- Added necessary types for feature and area MCP methods in types.ts
- Implemented feature and area MCP tools in core-server.ts following the existing patterns
- Created comprehensive tool descriptions in docs/mcp-tool-descriptions.md
- Updated debug_code_path handler to reflect new implementation status
- Improved task listings to properly handle overview files and feature/area hierarchies

All functionality is now implemented according to the design specifications. Tests confirm that both the CLI and MCP interfaces work as expected, with consistent behavior across both interfaces. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding new capabilities for feature and area management.
