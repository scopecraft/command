## Description

Fix the error logging issue in MCP list operations. Currently, successful list operations (like `task_list` and `phase_list`) report "41 errors" in the response message, even though the operation completes successfully.

## Issues Identified

During MCP testing, the following issues were observed:

1. Successful list operations include a message like "Listed X tasks with 41 errors"
2. The error count is consistently 41 across different list operations
3. Despite reporting errors, the operations return correct data

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Execute any list operation, such as `task_list` or `phase_list`
2. Observe the response message includes "with 41 errors" despite successfully returning data

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate the source of the "41 errors" message in list operations
- [ ] Check error handling and logging in `src/mcp/handlers.ts` for list operations
- [ ] Determine if these are actual errors or a logging issue
- [ ] Fix the error counting or message formatting to accurately reflect operation status
- [ ] Test fix with various list operations to ensure errors are reported accurately
- [ ] Update any related documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- List operations report correct error counts (zero for successful operations)
- Response messages accurately reflect operation results
- Fix applies to all list operations (tasks, phases, etc.)
- Error handling and reporting is consistent across different methods
