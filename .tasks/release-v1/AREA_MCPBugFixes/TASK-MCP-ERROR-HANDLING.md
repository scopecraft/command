## Description

Improve error handling in the MCP server for non-existent resources. Currently, when requesting operations on resources that don't exist (like getting a non-existent task), the error handling is inadequate.

## Issues Identified

During MCP testing, the following error handling issues were discovered:

1. Requesting a non-existent task doesn't return a clear error message
2. The error response doesn't follow a consistent format
3. Error responses may not provide sufficient information for clients to handle them effectively

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Attempt to get a task with an ID that doesn't exist: `task_get` with `id: "NON-EXISTENT-TASK-ID"`
2. Attempt to update a non-existent task: `task_update` with `id: "NON-EXISTENT-TASK-ID"`
3. Observe the error response format and content

## Tasks

- [ ] Review current error handling in `src/mcp/handlers.ts` for non-existent resources
- [ ] Implement consistent error response format with clear messages
- [ ] Add appropriate status codes to error responses
- [ ] Ensure error responses include enough detail for clients to handle them
- [ ] Test error handling with various non-existent resource scenarios
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect improved error handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- Error responses for non-existent resources follow a consistent format
- Error messages clearly indicate the nature of the error (e.g., "Task with ID 'XYZ' not found")
- Error responses include appropriate status codes
- Error handling is consistent across all MCP methods
- Documentation is updated to describe error handling behavior
