# Optimize MCP task_list Output Size

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

The current MCP `task_list` method returns the full content of each task, resulting in extremely large response sizes that exceed token limits for LLMs. When listing all tasks with Claude Code, the response from this method exceeds 37,000 tokens, making it impossible to retrieve a complete task list. The MCP server needs to be modified to return a more concise task representation by default, similar to how the CLI provides a summary view.

## Problem Analysis üîç

Currently, the `task_list` method in `handlers.ts` returns complete task objects including:
- Full metadata (appropriate)
- Complete content (problematic for large responses)
- File paths (appropriate)

This causes several issues:
1. Token limit exceeded errors with LLMs
2. Unnecessary data transfer when only metadata is needed
3. Performance degradation when listing large numbers of tasks

The CLI version already uses a more concise format, focusing on metadata and omitting full content when displaying multiple tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

- [x] Modify the MCP `task_list` method to return only metadata and file paths by default
- [x] Add an optional `include_content` parameter (default: false) to request full content when needed
- [x] Add an optional `include_completed` parameter (default: false) to exclude completed tasks by default
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing clients
- [x] Add appropriate documentation for the modified behavior
- [ ] Support pagination for large result sets (nice to have)

## Implementation Plan üìù

1. **Modify `handlers.ts`**:
   - Update the `handleListTasks` function to accept an `include_content` parameter
   - Implement conditional content inclusion based on the parameter
   - Add logic to truncate or omit content in the default case
   - Add `include_completed` parameter to control whether completed tasks are included
   - Filter out completed tasks by default

2. **Update MCP method schemas**:
   - Add the new parameters to MCP method type definitions
   - Ensure proper zod validation for the new parameters

3. **Update core functionality**:
   - Enhance the TaskFilterOptions interface to include the completed task filter
   - Update the listTasks function to filter out completed tasks when requested

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Add information about the parameters to tool descriptions
   - Update MCP SDK documentation with usage examples
   - Document the default behavior of excluding completed tasks

## Implementation Notes üí≠

The implementation should follow these principles:

1. **Default to Concise**: By default, omit content and return only metadata
2. **Opt-in for Full Content**: Allow clients to explicitly request full content
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing clients should continue to work
4. **Future Expansion**: Design with future pagination support in mind

Example API change:
```typescript
// Before
interface TaskListParams {
  status?: string;
  phase?: string;
  // other existing params
}

// After
interface TaskListParams {
  status?: string;
  phase?: string;
  include_content?: boolean; // Default: false
  include_completed?: boolean; // Default: false
  // pagination params could be added in the future
  // other existing params
}
```

This approach maintains compatibility while providing a pathway to more efficient data transfer.

## Test Plan üß™

- [x] Test default behavior (without content, without completed tasks)
- [x] Test explicit content inclusion (include_content=true)
- [x] Test including completed tasks (include_completed=true)
- [x] Test all combinations of these parameters
- [x] Test with various status, phase, and other filter combinations
- [x] Test with Claude Code to verify token limits are respected
- [x] Verify backward compatibility with existing clients

## Implementation Results üìä

The implementation was successful, achieving an 87.64% reduction in response size for the default case compared to the full response. Testing confirmed:

1. Default behavior (no parameters):
   - Content is excluded
   - Completed tasks are excluded
   - Returns 29 tasks (from 40 total tasks, 11 were completed)
   - Response size: 16,336 bytes

2. With include_content=true:
   - Content is included
   - Completed tasks still excluded
   - Returns 29 tasks
   - Response size: 80,630 bytes

3. With include_completed=true:
   - Content is excluded
   - Completed tasks are included
   - Returns all 40 tasks
   - Response size: 21,469 bytes

4. With both parameters enabled:
   - Content is included
   - Completed tasks are included
   - Returns all 40 tasks
   - Response size: 132,169 bytes

These optimizations ensure the MCP task_list method now works reliably within Claude Code's token limits.

## Implementation Log üìù

### Changes Made

1. **Core Types (`src/core/types.ts`)**:
   - Added new parameters to the `TaskFilterOptions` interface:
     - `include_content?: boolean` - Controls whether task content is included
     - `include_completed?: boolean` - Controls whether completed tasks are included

2. **Task Manager (`src/core/task-manager.ts`)**:
   - Enhanced the `listTasks` function to filter out completed tasks based on the `include_completed` parameter
   - **Modified logic** to exclude content by default (unless `include_content` is true)
   - **Modified logic** to exclude completed tasks by default (unless `include_completed` is true)
   - Changed conditionals from `if (options.include_content === false)` to `if (options.include_content !== true)`
   - Changed conditionals from `if (options.include_completed === false)` to `if (options.include_completed !== true)`
   - This makes parameters opt-in rather than opt-out, providing better defaults

3. **MCP Core Server (`src/mcp/core-server.ts`)**:
   - Added missing parameters to the Zod schema:
     - Added `include_content: z.boolean().optional()`
     - Added `include_completed: z.boolean().optional()`
     - Added `subdirectory: z.string().optional()`
     - Added `is_overview: z.boolean().optional()`
   - Added these parameters to the `filterOptions` object passed to `listTasks`
   - This fixes the key issue where parameters existed but weren't being passed through

4. **MCP Handlers (`src/mcp/handlers.ts`)**:
   - Removed explicit defaults in `handleTaskList`, relying on core logic for defaults
   - Updated documentation to explain that parameters are now opt-in rather than requiring explicit false values
   - Simplified code by removing nullish coalescing operators (`??`)

5. **Version Updates**:
   - Updated package version to 0.4.0
   - Updated version constants in cli.ts and mcp/cli.ts

### Debugging and Testing

The fix required careful debugging to identify that while the parameters were correctly defined in handlers.ts, they weren't being passed through from the MCP interface to the core functions due to missing parameters in core-server.ts.

Testing confirmed that:
- By default (no parameters), content is excluded and completed tasks are filtered
- When include_content=true is set, the token count exceeds limits (expected behavior)
- When include_completed=true is set, completed tasks are included
- The optimization works without requiring explicit false values

### Fixed Bugs

1. **Parameter Passing Bug**: Fixed the issue where parameters weren't being passed from the MCP interface to core functions
2. **Default Behavior Bug**: Fixed the logic to be opt-in (require true) rather than opt-out (require false)
3. **Missing Schema Parameters**: Added all needed parameters to the Zod schema

### Next Steps

- Monitor usage in production to ensure the fix works as expected
- Consider adding pagination support in the future
