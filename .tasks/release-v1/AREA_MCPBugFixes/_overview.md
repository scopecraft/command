# Advanced Phase Management

## Description

This feature implements a complete set of phase management capabilities, enabling users to create, update, delete, and archive phases with proper handling of tasks and directory structures. The goal is to provide a robust set of tools for organizing and managing project phases throughout their lifecycle.

## Key Components

- Phase update operations (renaming, status changes, metadata updates)
- Phase archiving functionality
- CLI commands for phase management
- MCP methods for programmatic phase operations
- Named filters for efficient task listing
- Comprehensive documentation

## Current Tasks

1. **Implement Phase Update Operation** (001_update_phase) âœ… - Core functionality to update phase properties
2. **Implement Phase Archive Operation** (002_archive_phase) - Mark phases as complete while preserving content
3. **Add CLI Commands for Phase Management** (003_cli_commands) âœ… - User interface for phase operations
4. **Add MCP Methods for Phase Operations** (004_mcp_methods) âœ… - Programmatic interface for phase management
5. **Implement Named Filters for Task Listing** (005_named_filters) - Simplified common queries
6. **Update Documentation for Phase Management** (006_documentation) - Comprehensive guidance

## Success Criteria

- Complete CRUD operations for phases
- Proper handling of phase content during updates and archiving
- Consistent interface through both CLI and MCP
- Efficient filtering capabilities for tasks
- Clear documentation for all operations
- Seamless integration with MDTM directory structure
- All MCP server implementations provide consistent behavior
- Error messages are clear and helpful
- Edge cases are properly handled
- No unexplained failures or incorrect behaviors
