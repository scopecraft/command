# Feature Proposal: Enable Project Root Configuration for AI IDE Support

**Note: This proposal has been converted to a feature. See FEATURE_project-root-configuration for implementation details.**

## Problem Statement
Scopecraft is completely unusable in AI IDEs other than Claude Code (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) because MCP servers are spawned from the application location rather than the project directory. This blocks 50% of beta testers and limits development to a single IDE.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a flexible root directory override system that accepts project path configuration through multiple methods with clear precedence order. Start with CLI parameters and an init_root command, building a foundation for future worktree support.

## Key Benefits
- Unblocks 50% of beta testers immediately
- Enables development in any AI IDE
- Supports multi-project workflows from day one
- Provides foundation for future worktree support

## Scope
### Included
- CLI parameter for root directory override
- init_root MCP command for runtime configuration
- Multi-project support (via config file or init_root switching)
- Clear precedence order for multiple configuration methods
- Support for at least Cursor and one other AI IDE

### Not Included
- Full worktree management UI (future enhancement)
- Automatic project switching based on context
- Claude Desktop project confusion resolution (lower priority)

## Technical Approach
Implement a core override system that accepts project root at multiple levels:
- Per-request (if MCP protocol allows)
- Per-session (via init_root command)
- Per-startup (via CLI parameter)
- Config file support for project registry

Maintain backward compatibility with existing auto-detection. Use clear precedence: CLI > Session > Request > Config > Auto-detect.

## Complexity Assessment
**Overall Complexity**: Medium

Factors:
- Need to support multiple configuration methods
- Different MCP client behaviors
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Basic multi-project switching required
- Unknown variations in client capabilities

## Dependencies & Risks
- Different MCP clients may have varying configuration capabilities
- Claude Desktop has known project confusion issues
- Some configuration methods may not work with all clients
- Need to research specific Cursor and Claude Desktop behaviors

## Open Questions
- Can MCP protocol support per-request root override?
- How does Cursor handle MCP server spawning per window?
- What's the best precedence order for configuration methods?
- Should we support environment variables in phase 1?
- Best approach for multi-project config (JSON file vs init commands)?

## Implementation Plan
**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
1. Add CLI parameter support (`--root-dir` or similar)
2. Implement init_root MCP command
3. Basic multi-project support (config file or init_root switching)
4. Focus on Cursor support first
5. Documentation and testing

**Phase 2 (Future)**:
- Enhanced multi-project UI
- Automatic project detection
- Better integration with worktrees
- Project context persistence

## Success Criteria
- Scopecraft works in Cursor successfully
- Works in at least one other AI IDE
- Can switch between multiple projects in same session
- All beta testers can test the tool
- Clear documentation on usage
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Human Review Required
- [ ] Assumption: MCP protocol can support per-request overrides
- [ ] Technical approach for different client behaviors needs research
- [ ] Best multi-project configuration method (config file vs commands)
- [ ] Exact CLI parameter syntax to be determined during implementation
- [ ] Priority order for configuration methods needs validation
