# Add Specialized Development Flow Commands

## Description

Enhance the development workflow by creating specialized Claude commands that guide users through a structured feature development process. This will improve consistency, reduce context loss between sessions, and ensure proper documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

## Background

The current task system is lightweight and implementation-focused. We need to add commands that:
1. Guide through feature proposal → PRD → planning → execution
2. Create proper breadcrumbs for future Claude sessions
3. Leverage existing task system (phases, features, areas, tasks)
4. Provide specialized guidance for different technical domains

## Implementation Approach: Hybrid Strategy

Based on analysis, we'll use a hybrid approach balancing maintainability with performance:

### Specialized Commands (Major Workflow Differences)
- `/project:01_brainstorm-feature` - Generate initial feature ideas (Step 1)
- `/project:02_feature-proposal` - Create formal proposal with requirements (Step 2)  
- `/project:03_feature-to-prd` - Transform proposal into detailed PRD (Step 3)
- `/project:04_feature-planning` - Create comprehensive task breakdown (Step 4)

These have fundamentally different purposes and require distinct prompts. The numeric prefix ensures users follow the workflow in the correct order.

### Generic Commands with Modes (Technical Variations)
- `/project:05_implement typescript TASK-123` - Core development tasks
- `/project:05_implement ui TASK-123` - UI/UX implementation
- `/project:05_implement mcp TASK-123` - MCP server implementation
- `/project:05_implement cli TASK-123` - CLI feature implementation
- `/project:test TASK-123` - Testing strategy and implementation
- `/project:integrate TASK-123` - Cross-area integration work

These share common patterns but need domain-specific guidance.

### Feature-Level Commands
- `/project:implement-next` - Automatically find and implement next task in feature
- `tw-feat-start` - Create worktree for feature instead of individual task

### Implementation Example

```markdown
# /project:05_implement command structure

<task>
You are implementing a task. Load domain-specific guidance based on the mode.
</task>

<mode_detection>
Mode requested: $ARGUMENTS
Extract mode (first word) and task ID (remaining).
</mode_detection>

<load_guidance>
Based on mode, incorporate domain-specific patterns:
- typescript: Focus on type safety, core logic patterns
- ui: Use Scopecraft UI components, terminal aesthetic
- mcp: Follow MCP protocol, tool patterns
- cli: Command structure, argument parsing
</load_guidance>

```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
1. **Reduced duplication** for similar workflows
2. **Specialized commands** where truly different
3. **Extensible** - easy to add new implementation modes
4. **Maintainable** - shared logic in one place
5. **Clear user experience** - logical command groupings

## Requirements

### System Knowledge All Commands Need

1. **Core Understanding**:
   - Task hierarchy and relationships
   - MCP tools prefix: `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__*`
   - Organizational structure (see Organizational Structure Guide)
   - Phases are project/release milestones, NOT task statuses

2. **File Locations**:
   - Templates: `/docs/templates/`
   - Documentation: `/docs/`
   - Commands: `/.claude/commands/`
   - Command Resources: `/docs/command-resources/`
   - Organizational Guide: `/docs/organizational-structure-guide.md`

3. **Conventions**:
   - Task ID format: `TASK-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
   - Always use MCP tools, not CLI
   - Create breadcrumbs for context
   - Understand phases vs statuses distinction
   - Always update task logs and checklists
   - Use numeric prefixes for ordered workflow commands

### Organizational Structure Guidelines

1. **Phases**: Project/release milestones (v1, v1.1, backlog, brand-refresh)
   - High-level project organization
   - Similar to MDTM's phase concept
   - Used for release planning and prioritization
   
2. **Statuses**: Task lifecycle stages (planning, implementation, testing, review, done)
   - Track individual task progress
   - Different from phases - this is task-level workflow
   
3. **Features**: User-facing capabilities that can span areas
   - Deliverable units of functionality
   - May contain multiple tasks across different statuses
   - Assigned to specific phases for release planning
   
4. **Areas**: Major functional domains
   - `cli` - Command-line interface
   - `mcp` - MCP server and AI integration
   - `ui` - Web interface (tasks-ui)
   - `core` - Core task management logic
   - `docs` - Documentation
   - `devops` - Build, deployment, testing
   - `orchestrator` - Work coordination and parallel task management
   
5. **Tasks**: Specific, actionable work items
   - Atomic units of work
   - Have both a phase (release) and status (progress)
   - Belong to an area and potentially a feature

   - References command creation guide
   - Includes pattern research from existing commands
   - Handles project vs user command decision
   - Generates commands following established patterns
   - Emphasizes MCP tool usage and documentation references

### 2025-05-18 - Command Naming Enhancement

**Completed:**
1. Added numeric prefixes to workflow commands:
   - Renamed `brainstorm-feature` to `01_brainstorm-feature`
   - Renamed `feature-proposal` to `02_feature-proposal`
   - Renamed `feature-to-prd` to `03_feature-to-prd`
   - Renamed `feature-planning` to `04_feature-planning`

2. Updated all documentation:
   - Fixed references in README.md
   - Updated claude-commands-guide.md
   - Corrected examples in feature-development-workflow.md
   - Enhanced create-command.md to mention numeric prefixes

**Rationale:** Numeric prefixes ensure users follow the workflow in the correct order, reducing confusion about command sequence.

### 2025-05-18 - Brainstorm Command Critical Enhancement

**Completed:**
1. Revised `01_brainstorm-feature` command to be more critical and challenging:
   - Changed task description from helpful assistant to "critical-thinking brainstorming partner"
   - Updated interaction style to be direct and intellectually honest
   - Added aggressive challenge formats (Critical Question, Challenge, Red Flag)
   - Revised example session to demonstrate skeptical questioning
   - Added pushback on assumptions and "nice to have" features
   - Included demands for evidence and specific numbers
   - Questions whether problems are genuine or just inconveniences
   - Challenges solution-looking-for-problem thinking

2. Key changes to example dialogue:
   - Opens with challenge: "That's pretty vague. Are you actually forgetting..."
   - Questions actual cost: "What's the actual cost of not having this?"
   - Demands specifics: "How often is 'sometimes'? Once a week? Once a month?"
   - Challenges workflow: "That might be a workflow problem, not a software problem"
   - Questions habits: "So you can't maintain a simple habit, but you think adding a feature will magically solve this?"
   - Calls out YAGNI principle
   - Suggests alternative solutions (changing habits)
   - Notes when addressing symptoms vs root causes

**Rationale:** The brainstorm command was too agreeable and treated all ideas as valuable. The revised version acts as a true technical advisor who challenges assumptions, questions perceived problems, and ensures only genuinely valuable features get built.

### 2025-05-18 - Brainstorm Command Requirements Focus

**Completed:**
1. Further refined `01_brainstorm-feature` to prevent drift into technical implementation:
   - Changed role from "technical advisor" to "requirements analyst"
   - Added CRITICAL directive to stay focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
   - Updated Phase 2 to focus on user value instead of technical complexity
   - Revised Phase 3 to emphasize user perspective and success criteria
   - Removed all technical implementation references from examples
   - Added "Requirements Focus" format for redirecting technical discussions

2. Key changes throughout:
   - Replaced "technical complexity" with "user benefit"
   - Changed "implementation" language to "requirements" language
   - Added redirect patterns for when users drift into technical details
   - Updated example options to describe outcomes, not implementations
   - Revised output format to focus on success criteria and constraints
   - Emphasized measurable outcomes over technical considerations

**Rationale:** User testing showed the command was drifting into technical implementation details. The requirements-focused version ensures brainstorming stays at the appropriate conceptual level, leaving implementation details for later phases.

### 2025-05-18 - Brainstorm Command Task Creation (Reverted)

**Note:** Initially updated the brainstorm command to create tasks directly, but reverted this change as it's cleaner to keep commands focused on their specific roles. The brainstorm command now:
- Provides a summary with all proposal elements
- Includes complexity assessment instead of time estimates  
- Clearly indicates next step to use 02_feature-proposal
- Keeps separation of concerns between commands

**Rationale:** Each command should do one thing well. Brainstorming generates ideas and summaries, while the proposal command creates the actual task.

### 2025-05-18 - Feature-Level Implementation Commands

**Completed:**
1. Created `tw-feat-start` command:
   - Added to `src/scripts/task-worktree.ts`
   - Creates worktree for entire feature instead of single task
   - Converts FEATURE_name to feature-name for git branch
   - Shows available features list if no ID provided
   - Created fish shell integration function
   - Added npm script to package.json
   - Updated README with worktree management section

2. Created `/project:implement-next` Claude command:
   - Automatically finds next task in a feature to implement
   - Accepts feature ID, natural language, or auto-detects from worktree
   - Queries feature for child tasks
   - Filters by status, dependencies, and blocking tasks
   - Determines implementation mode based on area
   - Calls `/project:05_implement {mode} {task_id}` automatically
   - Provides clear error messages for edge cases
   - Documents selection logic for human review

**Key Features:**
- Simple single-worktree approach (95% sequential work)
- Auto-detection from current directory
- Smart task prioritization (in-progress > todo)
- Dependency checking
- Area-based mode selection
- Integration with existing implement command

**Next Steps:**
- Create test feature to validate workflow
- Add mode-specific implementation guides
- Create test and integrate commands
- Test command flow end-to-end
- Update existing commands to new patterns

### 2025-05-19 - Code Review Analysis

**Analysis of current implementation status:**

1. **Implemented Commands:**
   - ✅ `/project:01_brainstorm-feature` - Critical brainstorming with requirements focus
   - ✅ `/project:02_feature-proposal` - Creates structured proposals
   - ✅ `/project:03_feature-to-prd` - Transforms to detailed PRD
   - ✅ `/project:04_feature-planning` - Task breakdown and planning
   - ✅ `/project:05_implement` - Generic implementation with mode detection
   - ✅ `/project:implement-next` - Auto-finds next task in feature
   - ✅ `/project:create-command` - Meta command for creating commands
   - ✅ `tw-feat-start` - Worktree management for features

2. **Missing Commands:**
   - ❌ `/project:test` - Testing strategy and implementation
   - ❌ `/project:integrate` - Cross-area integration work

3. **Missing Mode Documentation:**
   - ❌ `/docs/command-resources/implement-modes/typescript.md`
   - ❌ `/docs/command-resources/implement-modes/ui.md`
   - ❌ `/docs/command-resources/implement-modes/mcp.md`
   - ❌ `/docs/command-resources/implement-modes/cli.md`

4. **Additional Modes to Consider:**
   - `docs` - Documentation updates
   - `devops` - CI/CD and deployment
   - `api` - API design and implementation
   - `refactor` - Code refactoring
   - `performance` - Performance optimization
   - `security` - Security-focused tasks

5. **Review Command Comparison:**
   - Created before this task with simpler structure
   - Includes sophisticated task auto-detection logic
   - No mode detection (single purpose)
   - Good template for test/integrate commands

**Key Findings:**
- Core workflow is complete (idea → proposal → PRD → planning → implementation)
- Implementation mode system is designed but needs documentation
- Test and integrate commands missing to complete the development lifecycle
- Mode documentation files would provide domain-specific guidance

## Related Information

- Existing commands: `/project:review`, `/project:add-react-feature`
- Guide: `/docs/claude-commands-guide.md`
- Organizational Structure: `/docs/organizational-structure-guide.md`
- Command Resources: `/docs/command-resources/`
- Templates: `/docs/templates/`
- MCP tools documentation: `/docs/mcp-tool-descriptions.md`

## Notes

- Commands should be aware of context limitations and create breadcrumbs
- Each command should reference relevant documentation and templates
- Specialized commands should integrate with existing UI patterns and conventions
- Focus on creating a smooth workflow from ideation to implementation
- Commands must understand the organizational structure correctly:
  - Phases = project/release milestones (v1, v1.1, backlog)
  - Statuses = task lifecycle (planning, implementation, done)
  - Areas = technical domains
  - Features = user-facing capabilities
- Generic commands need robust argument parsing for mode detection
- Consider future extensibility when designing mode system
- Always update task logs and checklists to maintain context across sessions
- Human review sections prepare for future orchestrator with human-in-the-loop
- Meta command created to help create future commands systematically
- Workflow commands use numeric prefixes for clear ordering
