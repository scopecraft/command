## Description

Enhance the CLI and core functionality to fully support MDTM-style directory structures with feature folders as subdirectories within phases. This is a prerequisite for organizing tasks according to the MDTM standard and will enable us to restructure existing tasks into epics with subtasks.

## Background & Analysis

The Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) standard organizes tasks in a hierarchical structure:

```
tasks/
  FEATURE_authentication/  # Feature directory
    _overview.md           # Epic/feature overview
    001_login_ui.md        # Individual tasks
    002_login_logic.md
  AREA_refactoring/        # Another organizational directory
    ...
```

Currently, our system:
- Can discover and list tasks in subdirectories (recursive file scanning is working)
- Cannot create tasks in subdirectories (task creation only supports phase directory level)
- Has limited path handling for tasks in subdirectories

To implement MDTM-compatible directory structures, we need to enhance our code to fully support creation, retrieval, and management of tasks within subdirectories.

## Tasks

- [x] Enhance the ProjectConfig and path management
  - [x] Update `getTaskFilePath` to support subdirectories within phases
  - [x] Add new function to parse/generate subdirectory paths
  - [x] Ensure consistent path handling throughout the codebase

- [x] Update task creation functionality
  - [x] Modify `createTask` to accept a subdirectory parameter
  - [x] Implement automatic creation of subdirectories as needed
  - [x] Support FEATURE_*/AREA_* prefixes in directory names

- [x] Enhance task management functions
  - [x] Update `getTask` to handle tasks in subdirectories
  - [x] Ensure `updateTask` works correctly with nested paths
  - [x] Maintain proper phase relationships with subdirectory tasks

- [x] Update CLI commands
  - [x] Add `--subdirectory` option to task creation commands
  - [x] Add support for path specification in task get/update commands
  - [x] Update help documentation with new options

- [x] Add MCP method support
  - [x] Update MCP handlers to support subdirectory parameters
  - [x] Ensure consistent behavior between CLI and MCP

- [x] Add support for _overview.md files
  - [x] Implement special handling for files named _overview.md
  - [x] Link tasks to their parent overview if available

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLI can create tasks in subdirectories: `roo-task create --phase "release-v1" --subdirectory "FEATURE_Login" ...`
- Tasks in subdirectories can be retrieved, updated, and managed like any other task
- Tasks within FEATURE_* directories maintain their phase association
- _overview.md files receive special treatment as feature/epic summaries
- All existing functionality continues to work for tasks not using subdirectories
- MCP methods provide equivalent functionality to CLI commands

## Implementation Notes

The implementation should:

1. Add a `subdirectory` parameter to relevant functions, defaulting to empty string for backward compatibility
2. Handle path construction carefully to avoid platform-specific issues:
   ```typescript
   // Example approach
   const taskDir = subdirectory
     ? path.join(phaseDir, subdirectory)
     : phaseDir;
   ```
3. Support relative paths in task references (e.g., in `depends_on` fields)
4. Update all functions that manipulate task files to be aware of the deeper directory structure

## Path Forward

Once this task is completed, we can reorganize larger tasks (like TASK-20250510T140839 "Complete Phase Management Functions") into proper epics with subtasks:

1. Create a feature directory: `.tasks/release-v1/FEATURE_PhaseManagement/`
2. Move the main task content to `_overview.md`
3. Create individual subtasks for each component

This reorganization will better align our task structure with the MDTM standard while maintaining compatibility with our existing tooling.

## MDTM Standard Reference

This implementation should follow the directory structure conventions from the MDTM standard:

- Top-level directories use ALL_CAPS with prefixes (FEATURE_, AREA_)
- Overview files use leading underscore (_overview.md)
- Task files can use sequence numbers and emoji prefixes (001_âž•_login_ui.md)

See the full MDTM standard at `/docs/specs/mdtm_standard.md` for complete reference.

## Implementation Log

The implementation of MDTM directory structure support was completed successfully with the following key changes:

1. **Core Module Updates**:
   - Enhanced `ProjectConfig` with subdirectory support:
     - Updated `getTaskFilePath` to support subdirectories
     - Added `getTaskDirectory` and `ensureTaskDirectory` helper functions
     - Added `parseTaskPath` for extracting phase and subdirectory from paths
   - Extended `TaskMetadata` with new fields:
     - Added `subdirectory` field to track subdirectory location
     - Added `is_overview` flag for special overview files
   - Updated task management functions:
     - Modified `createTask` to accept subdirectory parameter
     - Enhanced `getTask` to support phase and subdirectory lookup
     - Updated `updateTask` to handle moving tasks between subdirectories
     - Improved `deleteTask` to handle subdirectory cleanup

2. **CLI Module Updates**:
   - Added `--subdirectory` option to relevant commands:
     - `create` - For creating tasks in subdirectories
     - `list` - For filtering tasks by subdirectory
     - `get` - For finding tasks in specific locations
     - `update` - For modifying tasks in subdirectories
     - `delete` - For removing tasks from subdirectories
   - Added `--overview` option to list command for finding feature overviews
   - Added special handling for `_overview.md` files

3. **MCP Module Updates**:
   - Extended MCP types and handlers to support all subdirectory features
   - Added subdirectory parameter to all task operations
   - Implemented special handling for overview files

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/mdtm-directory-structure.md`
   - Updated README.md with subdirectory usage examples
   - Created test scripts for subdirectory functionality
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with guidance on using the MDTM directory structure

These changes collectively enable full support for MDTM directory structures while maintaining backward compatibility with existing task files. Users can now organize tasks in feature directories with overview files, following the MDTM standard.
