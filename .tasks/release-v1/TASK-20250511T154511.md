## Description

Set up Biome for linting and formatting, as well as proper TypeScript checking for the project. This will ensure code quality and catch potential issues early in development.

## Requirements

- [ ] Install Biome
- [ ] Create Biome configuration file
- [ ] Set up IDE integration for Biome
- [ ] Configure TypeScript checking
- [ ] Add npm scripts for linting, formatting, and type checking
- [ ] Update documentation with new development workflow
- [ ] Add integration with CI/CD pipeline if applicable

## Implementation Notes

### Biome Setup
- Install Biome: `bun add --dev @biomejs/biome`
- Create configuration file (biome.json) with appropriate rules
- Configure linting and formatting options

### TypeScript Checking
- Ensure TypeScript is installed: `bun add --dev typescript`
- Configure TypeScript checking with appropriate tsconfig.json settings
- Add npm script for type checking: `bun tsc --noEmit`

### Integration
- Add npm scripts for:
  - Formatting: `bun biome format --write .`
  - Linting: `bun biome lint .`
  - Type checking: `bun typecheck`
- Update documentation to include information about these tools
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality

## Additional Context

Biome is a fast, modern replacement for ESLint, Prettier, and other tools, bundled into a single tool. It's a good fit for this project because it will simplify the toolchain and potentially improve development experience.

This task is important for ensuring code quality and preventing issues in the task worktree scripts we've developed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Biome correctly identifies linting issues in the codebase
- [ ] Biome can format files according to project standards
- [ ] TypeScript checking correctly identifies type errors
- [ ] Developers can run all checks with simple npm scripts
- [ ] Documentation is updated with the new workflow
