# MCP Integration Feature

## Description

This feature area focuses on improving the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with LLMs and other clients. The goal is to make the MCP server more robust, fully compatible with Claude Code and other AI assistants, and provide a complete set of tools for task management.

## Key Components

- MCP server implementation and transports (HTTP, STDIO)
- Tool documentation and descriptions
- Template access and management
- Workflow methods and relationship handling

## Current Tasks

1. **Configure MCP Integration for LLMs** (TASK-20250510T140853) - Improve MCP integration with LLMs
2. **Enhance MCP Template Access** (TASK-MCP-TEMPLATE-INFO) - Provide better template discovery and access
3. **Fix StreamableHTTP Transport** (TASK-05-STREAMABLE-HTTP-FIX) - Fix connection issues with HTTP transport
4. **Implement Missing MCP Workflow Methods** (TASK-MCP-WORKFLOW-METHODS) - Ensure complete workflow functionality

## Success Criteria

- All MCP tools function correctly with Claude Code and other clients
- Template information is easily accessible through MCP
- All transports (HTTP, STDIO) are stable and reliable
- Workflow functionality is complete and consistent with CLI
