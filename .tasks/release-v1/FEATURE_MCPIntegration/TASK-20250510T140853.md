# Configure MCP Integration for LLMs

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement key Model Context Protocol (MCP) components to improve LLM integration with the task management system. Specifically, add MCP Resources for data access and MCP Prompts for standardized workflows, focusing on a minimal viable implementation for v1 that follows MCP best practices.

## Problem Analysis üîç

Currently, our MCP implementation relies heavily on Tools for all operations, including data retrieval. This approach doesn't fully leverage the MCP architecture, which distinguishes between:

- **Resources**: Application-controlled data sources (like templates, schemas)
- **Tools**: Model-controlled functions for actions with potential side effects
- **Prompts**: User-controlled templates for standardized workflows

By implementing proper Resources and Prompts, we can improve efficiency, reduce token usage, and provide more consistent interaction patterns for LLMs.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

### MCP Resources Implementation
- [ ] Implement `/resources/templates` to expose available templates as resources
- [ ] Implement `/resources/templates/{id}` to get specific template details
- [ ] Implement `/resources/schemas/task` to provide task metadata schema
- [ ] Implement `/resources/schemas/feature` to provide feature metadata schema
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing tool implementations

### MCP Prompts Implementation
- [ ] Create a Task Creation prompt template for guided task creation workflow
- [ ] Create a Task Update prompt template for structured status/metadata updates
- [ ] Create a Task Query prompt template to help LLMs formulate proper queries
- [ ] Ensure prompts follow MCP best practices for prompt design

### Documentation
- [ ] Document best practices for LLMs on when to use resources vs tools
- [ ] Add examples of how to use the new resources and prompts
- [ ] Update MCP server documentation to reflect new capabilities

## Implementation Plan üìù

### Phase 1: Conception & Design

#### A. Resource Design
- [ ] **Research MCP Resources**
  - Use WebSearch to review MCP resource specifications at modelcontextprotocol.io
  - Examine reference implementations, especially file system resources
  - Review MDTM specs to ensure alignment with project standards

- [ ] **Template Resources Design**
  - [ ] Define JSON schema for template listing (keep it simple, based on existing template functions)
  - [ ] Define JSON schema for template details (include content sample, metadata)
  - [ ] Create a simple sketch/diagram of how resources will connect to existing code

- [ ] **Schema Resources Design**
  - [ ] Extract current task schema from existing validation code
  - [ ] Extract feature schema from existing validation code
  - [ ] Format as clean JSON Schema documents

#### B. Prompt Design
- [ ] **Research MCP Prompts**
  - Use WebSearch to review official MCP prompt specifications
  - Review prompt examples from Anthropic and other implementations
  - Identify key elements required for effective prompts

- [ ] **Design Core Prompts**
  - [ ] Task Creation: Draft step-by-step workflow with real examples
  - [ ] Task Update: Draft workflow showing how to update status, priority, etc.
  - [ ] Task Query: Draft guidance on formulating effective queries
  - [ ] Save prompts as markdown files in docs/ directory

#### C. Integration Planning
- [ ] **Resource Framework**
  - [ ] Identify existing code paths in core-server.ts to extend
  - [ ] Sketch a simple implementation approach (maybe 10-20 lines of pseudocode)
  - [ ] Document the plan in a simple markdown file

- [ ] **Prompt Framework**
  - [ ] Identify where/how prompts will be stored (filesystem vs. code)
  - [ ] Sketch the basic prompt loading and serving mechanism
  - [ ] Document the plan in a simple markdown file

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### A. Resource Implementation
- [ ] Add resource handler framework to MCP server
- [ ] Implement template resources
- [ ] Implement schema resources
- [ ] Add basic tests

#### B. Prompt Implementation
- [ ] Add prompt handling to MCP server
- [ ] Implement the three core prompts
- [ ] Add discovery mechanism

#### C. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Write simple documentation for resources
- [ ] Write simple documentation for prompts
- [ ] Test with Claude Code
- [ ] Add examples to docs

## Implementation Notes üí≠

### Resources Implementation Approach
- Resources should be read-only and provide data without side effects
- The implementation should leverage existing data access methods but expose them through the resource interface
- Use filesystem-based approach for simplicity when possible

### Prompts Implementation Approach
- Prompts should follow the MCP prompt specification format
- Include clear descriptions, parameters, and expected outputs
- Keep prompts focused on specific workflows rather than trying to be too general
- Store prompts in text files for easy editing

### General Guidelines
- This implementation should focus on adding the new capabilities without major refactoring
- Existing tool implementations should be maintained for backward compatibility
- Follow MCP best practices for naming and organization
- Keep it simple and manageable for a small project

## Future Considerations (Post-v1)

- More extensive resource implementations for complex queries
- Additional prompt templates for advanced workflows
- Potential conversion of some existing tools to resources where appropriate
