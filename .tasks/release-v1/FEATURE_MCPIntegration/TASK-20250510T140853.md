# Configure MCP Prompts for LLMs

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) prompts to standardize LLM interactions with our task management system. This implementation will use direct Zod schemas with hardcoded prompts rather than parsing markdown files, focusing on a minimal, reliable implementation that adheres to the MCP specification.

## Prerequisites üîë

- Thorough understanding of the Model Context Protocol specification
- Familiarity with the MCP SDK (version 1.11+)
- Understanding of Zod schema validation

## Problem Analysis üîç

Our MCP implementation currently relies on tools for all operations but lacks proper prompt support. Adding well-structured prompts will:

- Provide consistent interaction patterns for LLMs
- Reduce token usage through standardized workflows
- Enable future extensibility for AI capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement at least three basic prompts using hardcoded Zod schemas:
  - Task creation prompt with required parameters for title, type, etc.
  - Task update prompt for changing task status/priority
  - Task query prompt for searching/filtering tasks
- [ ] Ensure all prompts are properly registered with the MCP server
- [ ] Verify prompts can be discovered via prompts/list method
- [ ] Verify prompts can be retrieved and used via getPrompt method

### Documentation
- [ ] Document each prompt's purpose, parameters, and example usage
- [ ] Create integration guide for LLM developers
- [ ] Document any limitations or considerations

## Implementation Plan üìù

### Phase 1: Research & Design
- [ ] Study MCP prompt specification in detail
- [ ] Examine reference implementations from Anthropic or other MCP providers
- [ ] Design basic schema structure for each prompt

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Create basic MCP prompt handler
- [ ] Implement task-creation prompt with Zod schema
- [ ] Implement task-update prompt with Zod schema
- [ ] Implement task-query prompt with Zod schema
- [ ] Register prompts with MCP server

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create test client to verify prompt functionality
- [ ] Test with MCP Inspector
- [ ] Document implementation and usage examples

## Technical Approach

For simplicity and reliability, this implementation will:
- Use hardcoded Zod schemas instead of parsing markdown files
- Register prompts directly with the MCP server
- Start with basic functionality before adding any advanced features
- Thoroughly test with both our test client and the MCP Inspector

## Future Considerations (v2)
- Add template-based prompt customization
- Implement completion handlers for parameter suggestions
- Add more specialized workflow prompts
