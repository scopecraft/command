## Description

Implement MCP methods for phase management operations to enable programmatic access through the Model Context Protocol.

## Tasks

- [x] Add MCP methods for phase operations
  - Implement `phase.update` method and handler
  - Implement `phase.delete` method and handler
  - Add appropriate parameters to `phase.list` method
  - Update MCP method registry

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] MCP server provides equivalent functionality to CLI commands
- [x] Method parameters follow existing MCP patterns
- [x] All phase operations are available through the MCP interface
- [x] Error handling follows existing patterns with clear messages
- [x] Response formats are consistent with other MCP methods

## Implementation Log

### Changes

- Added MCP methods for phase management operations:
  - `phase_update`: Update an existing phase (including name, description, status, ID renaming)
  - `phase_delete`: Delete a phase with option to force delete phases with tasks
  - Updated method registry to include new phase methods
- Added appropriate request/response types in `types.ts`
- Ensured consistent parameter handling and response formats
- Updated handler implementations to use core functions
- Added documentation for new MCP methods in CLAUDE.md

### Approach

The implementation leverages the core updatePhase and deletePhase functions, exposing their functionality through the MCP interface. The approach maintains consistency with other MCP methods while providing all the capabilities of the CLI interface.

All methods have been manually tested to verify functionality and error handling. The implementation was done alongside the CLI commands in the 003_cli_commands task.
