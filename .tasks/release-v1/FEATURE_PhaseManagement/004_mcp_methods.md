## Description

Implement MCP methods for phase management operations to enable programmatic access through the Model Context Protocol.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add MCP methods for phase operations
  - Implement `phase.update` method and handler
  - Implement `phase.archive` method and handler
  - Add archive parameter to `phase.list` method
  - Update MCP method registry

## Acceptance Criteria

- MCP server provides equivalent functionality to CLI commands
- Method parameters follow existing MCP patterns
- All phase operations are available through the MCP interface
- Error handling follows existing patterns with clear messages
- Response formats are consistent with other MCP methods

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain consistent behavior between CLI and MCP interfaces
- Ensure MCP methods can be invoked from Roo Commander's LLM agents
- Follow existing parameter and response patterns
