## Description

Add support for named/predefined filters to simplify common task listing operations.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement named filters for task listing
  - Design filter configuration structure
  - Add predefined filters for common queries (open, high-priority, assigned-to-me)
  - Enhance `listTasks` to support named filters
  - Add CLI and MCP support for using named filters

## Acceptance Criteria

- Task list filter supports common filter presets (open, high priority, etc.)
- Users can combine named filters with explicit filter criteria
- Filters are exposed through both CLI and MCP interfaces
- Filter definitions can be extended or customized
- Error handling follows existing patterns with clear messages

## Implementation Notes

- Consider multiple approaches for filter definitions:
  - Hard-coded in the codebase
  - Configurable through a config file
  - Combination of built-in and user-defined filters
- Balance flexibility with simplicity in the API design
