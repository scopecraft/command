# Phase Management Feature

## Description

This feature continues the implementation of phase management capabilities started in release-v1, focusing on more advanced functionality and completing the full set of phase management tools. The goal is to provide robust phase management that aligns with the MDTM standard.

## Key Components

- Named filters for task listing efficiency
- Phase archive functionality
- Advanced phase management operations
- Complete documentation

## Current Tasks

1. **Implement Named Filters for Task Listing** (005_named_filters) - Add support for predefined filter shortcuts
2. **Implement Phase Archive Operation** (002_archive_phase) - Mark phases as complete while preserving content

## Success Criteria

- Named filters work correctly for common query patterns
- Phase archiving properly preserves content while marking completion
- Documentation is comprehensive and user-friendly
- All functionality is consistent with MDTM standard
