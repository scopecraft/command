## Description

Prepare the project for distribution via NPM by configuring package settings, build pipeline, and version management.

## Tasks

- [x] Configure package.json for NPM distribution
- [x] Set up proper bin entries for CLI commands
- [x] Create build pipeline for distribution
- [x] Set up version management
- [x] Test installation process from NPM (dry run)
- [x] Create release documentation
- [x] Remove redundant SDK server implementation
- [x] Fix package.json formatting for npm standards
- [x] Set up local testing workflow
- [x] Update Claude configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Package can be installed globally via npm/yarn/bun
- [x] CLI commands work correctly after installation
- [x] MCP server can be started after installation
- [x] Version is properly managed and displayed in CLI
- [x] README includes installation instructions
- [x] Package can be tested locally before publishing

## Implementation Log

1. Updated package.json:
   - Set version to 0.3.0
   - Added 'files' field to specify what gets published
   - Added repository and publishing metadata
   - Added 'publishConfig' for public access
   - Added scripts for versioning and prepublishing
   - Fixed bin entries to follow npm standards
   - Set preferGlobal to true

2. Simplified package name and command structure:
   - Changed package name from @scopecraft/command to @scopecraft/cmd
   - Simplified binary names to be more intuitive:
     - scopecraft / sc - Main CLI
     - scopecraft-mcp / sc-mcp - MCP server
     - scopecraft-stdio / sc-stdio - STDIO transport

3. Created version management:
   - Added script to update CLI version numbers
   - Set up version script to keep version synchronized 

4. Updated build process:
   - Ensured executables have proper permissions (chmod)
   - Updated shebangs from 'bun' to 'node' for better compatibility

5. Created .npmignore file to exclude development files

6. Enhanced documentation:
   - Added NPM installation instructions to README.md
   - Updated CLI commands section with npx usage examples
   - Added local testing instructions

7. Consolidated MCP server implementations:
   - Removed redundant SDK server implementation
   - Kept core HTTP server with StreamableHTTP transport and STDIO server
   
8. Set up local testing workflow:
   - Created scripts for local package creation and installation
   - Successfully tested local package installation
   - Verified all CLI commands work correctly

9. Updated Claude integration:
   - Updated configuration to use the new package name and commands
   - Replaced old mcpServers entry with new one using proper binary names

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors before full release
2. Add CI/CD pipeline for automated publishing
