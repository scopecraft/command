## Description

Fix the existing TOML frontmatter parsing error: "Failed to parse TOML frontmatter: Missing required field: id" that's currently being tracked in TASK-02-TemplateParseError.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a task using a template
2. Observe the parsing error

## Expected Behavior

Tasks should be created from templates without parsing errors.

## Tasks

- [x] Investigate the root cause of the TOML parsing error
- [x] Fix template handling in task-parser.ts
- [x] Ensure all templates include required fields
- [x] Add validation to prevent similar issues
- [x] Add tests for template parsing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tasks can be created from all templates without errors
- [x] Parser properly handles missing fields with sensible defaults
- [x] Tests verify correct template parsing behavior
- [x] Documentation updated if template format requirements change

## Implementation Log

### Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was identified in two components:

1. In `src/core/task-parser.ts`, the parser strictly enforced that the `id` field must be present when parsing a task file.
2. In `src/core/template-manager.ts`, the `applyTemplate` function had issues with:
   - Not properly handling empty fields from templates
   - Not adding fields that were missing from templates but present in values
   - Potentially creating duplicate fields that caused TOML parsing errors
   - Not prioritizing critical fields like `id`

### Solution Implementation

The following changes were made:

1. **Improved error handling in CLI commands** (`src/cli/commands.ts`):
   - Added a try/catch block around `parseTaskFile` call when creating tasks from templates
   - Added explicit fallback logic to handle missing ID field errors by creating the task manually

2. **Completely rewrote the template handling code** (`src/core/template-manager.ts`):
   - Implemented a new approach that parses the template's TOML content first
   - Applies all values to the parsed object directly
   - Re-serializes using the TOML stringify function to avoid duplicates
   - Added special handling for required fields with warnings
   - Added explicit handling for the critical `id` field

3. **Added comprehensive tests** (`test/template-parsing.test.js`):
   - Test for handling empty ID in templates
   - Test for forcibly adding ID field when missing from template
   - Test for handling complex templates with multiple fields

### Verification

The implementation was verified by:

1. All tests pass, including the new template parsing tests
2. Manual testing with the CLI showed successful task creation from templates
3. The `applyTemplate` function now handles various edge cases:
   - Templates with empty ID fields
   - Templates completely missing ID fields
   - Templates with complex nested fields
   - Templates with duplicate or conflicting fields

The changes ensure that templates are robustly handled, preventing the "Missing required field: id" error while maintaining data integrity.
