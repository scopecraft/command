## Description

Improve the CLI help display to provide better organization, clarity, and discoverability of commands. The current help output lists all commands in a flat structure, including legacy commands, which can be confusing for users. This task aims to reorganize the help system to make it more structured and intuitive.

## Background & Analysis

The CLI uses Commander.js for command parsing and help generation. We recently implemented an entity-command pattern where commands are organized by entity type (task, phase, feature, area, workflow). However, the help output doesn't clearly communicate this organization, and still prominently displays legacy command formats.

Current issues with the help display:
1. No clear visual grouping of commands by entity type
2. Legacy commands are mixed with new entity-based commands
3. Lack of section headers to differentiate command groups
4. Redundant descriptions for legacy commands
5. Help text doesn't emphasize the recommended entity-command pattern

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Structured Command Groups**:
   - Group commands by entity type (task, phase, feature, area, workflow)
   - Add visual section headers for each group
   - Provide brief descriptions of what each entity group is for

2. **Command Handling**:
   - Keep only the most essential direct commands (`list`, `get`, `phases`) at the top level
   - Remove other legacy commands to reduce clutter
   - Maintain full functionality through entity-command pattern

3. **Help Text Customization**:
   - Use Commander.js's `.addHelpText()` to add formatted section headers
   - Add clearer descriptions for each command group
   - Add examples for common usage patterns

4. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Add clear separators between command groups
   - Use indentation or formatting to improve readability
   - Consider using color (if terminal supports it) for section headers

## Technical Implementation Approach

1. **Use Commander.js's help customization**:
   ```typescript
   program.addHelpText('beforeAll', `
   USAGE: sc [entity] [command] [options]
   
   Available entity types:
   - task       Task operations (create, list, update, etc.)
   - phase      Phase management operations
   - feature    Feature management operations
   - area       Area management operations
   - workflow   Task workflow and sequence operations
   `);
   ```

2. **Customize entity command groups**:
   ```typescript
   // Example for task command group
   taskCommand
     .description('Task management commands')
     .addHelpText('before', '\nTASK MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\n======================\n');
   ```

3. **Keep essential direct commands**:
   ```typescript
   // Add only the most essential top-level commands for convenience
   program
     .command('list')
     .description('List all tasks')
     // options...
     .action(handleListCommand);

   program
     .command('get <id>')
     .description('Get a task by ID')
     // options...
     .action(handleGetCommand);
   ```

4. **Clear command organization**:
   - Ensure consistent spacing and grouping in help output
   - Add visual separators between command groups
   - Use consistent terminology across all help text

## Tasks

- [x] Customize root program help text with overview of entity types
- [x] Add section headers for each entity command group
- [x] Improve command descriptions to be more informative
- [x] Keep only essential commands at the top level to reduce clutter
- [x] Add examples for common usage patterns
- [x] Test help output in different terminal environments
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md and documentation with new help format

## Acceptance Criteria

- Help output is clearly organized by entity type
- Section headers visually separate command groups
- Command descriptions are clear and informative
- Help display is clean and uncluttered
- Example usage patterns are provided
- Help text renders correctly in different terminal environments
- No functionality changes to existing commands

## Implementation Log

Completed the following improvements to the CLI help display:

1. Added structured overview to the root program help showing available entity types and usage examples
2. Added clear section headers for each entity command group (TASK MANAGEMENT COMMANDS, PHASE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS, etc.)
3. Kept only the most essential direct commands (list, get, phases) at the top level to reduce clutter
4. Enhanced command descriptions with practical examples for commonly used commands
5. Tested the help output in different scenarios to ensure proper formatting

This implementation uses Commander.js's addHelpText method for customizing the help display without modifying the core functionality of the commands. All functionality is maintained through the entity-command pattern, while the help display is now much cleaner and more organized.

The CLI help is now more intuitive and less overwhelming, especially for new users learning the command structure, while still providing convenient access to the most commonly used commands.
