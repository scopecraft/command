# Core Enhancements Feature

## Description

This feature area focuses on enhancing the core functionality of the task management system. The goal is to improve the underlying infrastructure, fix critical bugs, and prepare the project for distribution.

## Key Components

- Task ID generation and filename handling
- TOML frontmatter parsing and validation
- NPM package configuration and distribution

## Current Tasks

1. **Implement Separation Between Task IDs and Filenames** (TASK-ID-FILENAME-SEPARATION) - Add support for semantic IDs with flexible filename patterns
2. **Fix TOML Frontmatter Parsing Issue** (TASK-20250510T140908) - Fix bugs in template parsing
3. **Configure NPM Package and Distribution** (TASK-20250510T140846) - Prepare the project for distribution via NPM

## Success Criteria

- Task IDs and filenames can be managed independently
- TOML parsing is reliable and consistent
- The project can be distributed via NPM
- Core functionality is stable and well-tested
