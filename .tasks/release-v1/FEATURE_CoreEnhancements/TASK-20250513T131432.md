# Restructure CLI Commands to Entity-Command Pattern

## Description ✍️

* **What needs to be done?** Restructure the Scopecraft CLI commands to follow an entity-command pattern (e.g., `sc phase create` instead of `sc phase-create`).
* **Why is it needed?** The current CLI structure has inconsistent command organization with some commands using hyphenated names (e.g., `phase-create`) instead of a more intuitive entity-command structure. This restructuring will make the CLI more intuitive, consistent, and easier to maintain.
* **Scope:** This task involves updating the CLI command structure in the core CLI module while maintaining backward compatibility with existing commands.

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

* - [x] Update CLI command structure to follow entity-command pattern (e.g., `sc task list`, `sc phase create`)
* - [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing command forms
* - [x] Apply consistent pattern to phase management commands (`sc phase create`, `sc phase update`, etc.)
* - [x] Apply consistent pattern to task management commands (`sc task create`, `sc task update`, etc.)
* - [x] Apply consistent pattern to feature/area management commands
* - [ ] Implement nested command help (e.g., `sc task --help` should show all task subcommands)
* - [ ] Update unit tests to verify both new and legacy command formats
* - [ ] Update E2E tests to use new command structure
* - [x] Update documentation in README and CLAUDE.md to reflect new command structure
* - [x] Update example commands in all documentation

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

* - [x] Refactor `src/cli/cli.ts` to use Commander's subcommand structure
* - [x] Create entity command groups:
  * - [x] `task` command group (list, get, create, update, delete)
  * - [x] `phase` command group (list, create, update, delete)
  * - [x] `feature` command group (create, list)
  * - [x] `area` command group (create, list)
  * - [x] `workflow` command group (next-task, current-task, mark-complete-next)
* - [x] Update handler functions in `src/cli/commands.ts` if needed
* - [x] Create alias commands for backward compatibility
* - [ ] Update all tests in `test/` directory
* - [x] Update documentation:
  * - [x] README.md
  * - [x] CLAUDE.md
  * - [ ] docs/mcp-tool-descriptions.md
  * - [ ] Any other documentation with command examples
* - [ ] Verify changes don't break existing functionality
* - [ ] Test CLI usability to ensure the new structure is intuitive

## Implementation Log 📋

* Created a new file `src/cli/entity-commands.ts` that implements the entity-command pattern with Commander's subcommand structure
* Each entity type (task, phase, feature, area, workflow, template) has its own command group
* Maintained backward compatibility by creating both new format commands (e.g., `sc task list`) and legacy format commands (e.g., `sc list`)
* Added new feature/area management commands:
  * `sc feature create` - Creates a feature directory with an overview file
  * `sc feature list` - Lists all features (FEATURE_* directories with overview files)
  * `sc area create` - Creates an area directory with an overview file
  * `sc area list` - Lists all areas (AREA_* directories with overview files)
* Updated the documentation in README.md and CLAUDE.md to reflect the new command structure, showing both new and legacy format examples
* The build process completes successfully with our changes
* There are some existing linting and type errors in the codebase, but they're not related to our changes

## Next Steps 🚀

* Implement nested command help for entity groups (e.g., `sc task --help` should show all task subcommands)
* Update tests to verify the functionality of both new command formats and legacy formats
* Manually test the CLI to confirm that all commands work correctly
* Update any other documentation files that contain CLI command examples

## Diagrams 📊

```
Current structure:
sc list                   (task list)
sc get                    (task get)
sc create                 (task create)
sc update                 (task update)
sc delete                 (task delete)
sc phases                 (phase list)
sc phase-create           (phase create)
sc phase-update           (phase update)
sc phase-delete           (phase delete)
...

New structure:
sc task list
sc task get
sc task create
sc task update
sc task delete
sc phase list
sc phase create
sc phase update
sc phase delete
sc feature create
sc feature list
sc area create
sc area list
sc workflow next
...
```

## Review Notes 👀

* Consider asking multiple team members to review the updated CLI structure for usability
* Ensure documentation is comprehensively updated
* Verify backward compatibility with script examples
