# Design Core Configuration System with Precedence Logic

## Objective
Design a flexible configuration system that supports multiple methods of specifying the project root directory with clear precedence rules. This system should be extensible for future enhancements like worktree support.

## Design Requirements
1. Support multiple configuration sources (CLI, config file, runtime commands)
2. Clear precedence order: CLI > Session > Request > Config > Auto-detect
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing auto-detection
4. Prepare for future multi-project/worktree support
5. Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations

## Todo List
- [ ] Design configuration interface/contract
- [ ] Define precedence rules and override logic
- [ ] Plan configuration storage mechanism
- [ ] Design validation and error handling
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Plan migration path from current system
- [ ] Design configuration update mechanism
- [ ] Document configuration flow

## Configuration Sources
1. **CLI Parameter**: `--root-dir` passed at startup
2. **Session Command**: `init_root` MCP command
3. **Per-Request**: Root override in individual MCP requests (if supported)
4. **Config File**: JSON/YAML file with project registry
5. **Auto-detect**: Current working directory logic (fallback)

## Architecture Considerations
- Configuration manager singleton vs dependency injection
- Hot-reloading of configuration during runtime
- Thread-safety for concurrent requests
- Caching strategy for performance
- Extensibility for future sources

## Success Criteria
- Clear architecture documentation
- Defined interfaces and contracts
- Precedence logic clearly specified
- Error handling strategy documented
- Performance considerations addressed
- Migration plan from current system
