# Implement MCP init_root Command and Per-Request Support

## Objective
Implement MCP-specific configuration features including the init_root command for runtime configuration and per-request root override support (if protocol allows).

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create init_root MCP command handler
- [x] Implement session-level root configuration
- [ ] Add per-request root override (if supported by MCP protocol)
- [x] Integrate with core configuration system
- [x] Add MCP command validation
- [x] Implement error responses for invalid paths
- [x] Add logging for configuration changes
- [x] Write tests for MCP commands
- [x] Update MCP command documentation

## MCP Commands
1. **init_root**: Set project root for current session
   - Parameters: path (string)
   - Returns: success/error status
   - Persists for session duration

2. **get_current_root**: Get current project root
   - No parameters
   - Returns: current root path

3. **list_projects**: List available projects (if config file exists)
   - No parameters
   - Returns: array of project paths

## Integration Points
- Core configuration system
- Session management
- Request handler middleware
- Error handling system

## Success Criteria
- [x] init_root command works correctly
- [x] Session persistence implemented
- [ ] Per-request override working (pending MCP protocol support)
- [x] Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- [x] Tests cover all scenarios
- [x] Documentation updated

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-18 - Implementation Started
- Discovered that init_root, get_current_root, and list_projects are already implemented
- Need to fix TypeScript issues and code quality problems
- Main issues:
  - `any` type usage needs to be replaced with proper types
  - Return type mismatch in registerTools function
  - Excessive cognitive complexity in some handlers
- Starting with type fixes to pass code quality checks

### 2025-05-18 - TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed `any` types to use `unknown` for better type safety
- Changed empty object types to use `Record<string, never>`
- Fixed return type for registerTools function
- Simplified task creation handler by extracting helper functions
- Created createTaskMetadata and getDefaultTaskContent helpers

### 2025-05-18 - Testing and Verification
- Created comprehensive test suite for MCP configuration commands
- All tests passing (8/8)
- Verified commands work correctly:
  - init_root sets project root for session
  - get_current_root returns current configuration
  - list_projects lists configured projects
- Integration with task operations confirmed

### 2025-05-18 - Documentation and Tools
- Created MCP configuration commands documentation
- Added test client script for demonstration
- Created example usage script
- Committed all changes with ID 657c39c
- Task marked as Done

## Files Created/Modified
- `/src/mcp/types.ts` - Fixed TypeScript type issues
- `/src/mcp/core-server.ts` - Refactored to reduce complexity
- `/test/mcp-config-commands.test.ts` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `/docs/mcp-configuration-commands.md` - Complete command documentation
- `/scripts/test-mcp-config.ts` - Demo script for testing
- `/scripts/mcp-test-client.ts` - Simple test client implementation

## Testing Results
- Unit tests: 8/8 PASS
- TypeScript compilation: Fixed all type errors
- Code quality: Passed all checks after fixes
- Manual testing: Commands work as expected

## Human Review Needed

### Implementation Decisions to Verify
- [x] Using `unknown` instead of `any` for better type safety
- [x] Session-level persistence approach
- [x] Error message format and clarity
- [ ] Per-request override implementation (pending MCP protocol review)

### Technical Assumptions
- [x] Session persistence works across MCP requests
- [x] Configuration manager singleton pattern appropriate
- [ ] MCP protocol supports per-request configuration (needs investigation)
- [x] Test coverage adequate for all scenarios

## Summary
Successfully implemented MCP configuration commands with proper TypeScript types and comprehensive testing. The commands allow AI IDEs to set and manage project roots dynamically. Per-request override support is pending MCP protocol capabilities review. All other objectives have been completed.
