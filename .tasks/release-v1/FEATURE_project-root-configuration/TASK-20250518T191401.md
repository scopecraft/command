# Research MCP Client Behaviors and Configuration Capabilities

## Objective
Understand how different AI IDEs (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) handle MCP server configuration and spawning to determine the best approach for implementing project root overrides.

## WebSearch Queries
- "MCP server configuration Cursor IDE 2024"
- "Model Context Protocol client implementation patterns 2024"
- "Claude Desktop MCP server startup configuration"
- "Cursor IDE MCP server environment variables"
- "MCP protocol per-request configuration 2024"
- "AI IDE MCP server project root configuration"

## Questions to Answer
1. How does Cursor handle MCP server spawning per window?
2. What configuration options are available for MCP servers in different clients?
3. Can MCP protocol support per-request root directory overrides?
4. What environment variables are passed to MCP servers by different clients?
5. How do other MCP servers handle multi-project scenarios?
6. What are the limitations of Claude Desktop's MCP implementation?

## Investigation Areas
- MCP protocol documentation for configuration capabilities
- Cursor IDE documentation and forums
- Claude Desktop MCP implementation details
- Existing MCP servers that handle similar requirements
- Community discussions about MCP server configuration

## Todo List
- [ ] Search for MCP protocol documentation on configuration methods
- [ ] Investigate Cursor's MCP server spawning behavior
- [ ] Research Claude Desktop's limitations with project confusion
- [ ] Find examples of MCP servers with multi-project support
- [ ] Document configuration methods supported by each client
- [ ] Identify best practices for root directory handling
- [ ] Create comparison matrix of client capabilities

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of each client's configuration capabilities
- Identified limitations and workarounds for each IDE
- Documented best approach for implementing root overrides
- List of supported configuration methods per client
- Recommendations for implementation approach
