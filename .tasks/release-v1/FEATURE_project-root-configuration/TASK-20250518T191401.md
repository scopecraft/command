# Research MCP Client Behaviors and Configuration Capabilities

## Objective
Understand how different AI IDEs (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) handle MCP server configuration and spawning to determine the best approach for implementing project root overrides.

## Research Findings

### 1. MCP Configuration Methods by Client

#### Claude Desktop
- Configuration file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
- Format: JSON with `mcpServers` object
- Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "command",
      "args": ["args"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Limitation: Uses single global configuration for all projects

#### Cursor IDE
- Configuration file: `.cursor/mcp.json` in project root OR `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally
- Format: Similar JSON structure to Claude Desktop
- **Key Feature**: Supports project-specific MCP configuration
- Environment variables: Can be set in "env" property
- Current limitations:
  - No dynamic environment variable resolution
  - No "inputs" field like VS Code

#### VS Code (Preview)
- Configuration file: `.vscode/mcp.json` in workspace
- Supports workspace-specific configuration
- Provides servers with current workspace folders using "roots" concept
- Has "inputs" field for secure parameter prompting (not available in Cursor)

### 2. MCP Protocol Root Directory Support

#### "Roots" Concept
- MCP protocol has a **"roots"** specification that defines filesystem boundaries
- Roots allow clients to tell servers which directories they can access
- Servers can request `roots/list` to understand accessible directories
- Implementation is flexible - each client can expose roots differently

#### Per-Request Configuration
- No evidence of per-request root directory override in MCP protocol
- Most configuration happens at server startup time
- Clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop spawn servers with fixed configurations

### 3. Current Scopecraft Implementation Issues

#### Root Directory Detection
- Always uses `process.cwd()` to determine root directory
- Assumes MCP server is started from project directory
- Breaks when servers are spawned from application directory (AI IDEs)

#### Code Analysis
```typescript
// src/core/project-config.ts
private detectProjectMode(): ProjectMode {
  const ruruDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '.ruru');
  const tasksDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '.tasks');
  // Always relative to current working directory
}
```

### 4. Multi-Project Support Approaches

#### MCP Server Multiverse
- Enables multiple isolated instances of same MCP server
- Uses unique namespaces and configurations
- Each instance can point to different project directory

#### Filesystem MCP Server
- Can be configured with multiple directory paths
- Paths specified in "args" array determine accessible directories

#### Cursor's Project-Specific Configuration
- Recent feature addition
- Allows different MCP servers per project directory
- Uses `.cursor/mcp.json` in project root

### 5. Environment Variables and Configuration

#### Cursor Limitations
- Cannot reference system environment variables directly
- Requires hardcoding or wrapper scripts
- Community requesting dynamic environment variable resolution

#### Claude Desktop
- Supports "env" property for environment variables
- No per-project configuration
- Global server instances only

## Recommendations for Implementation

### 1. Priority Approach: CLI Parameter Support
- Add `--root-dir` parameter to MCP server startup commands
- Works with all clients without requiring protocol changes
- Can be specified in client configuration files

### 2. Multiple Configuration Methods (Priority Order)
1. CLI parameter (`--root-dir`)
2. Environment variable (`SCOPECRAFT_ROOT`)
3. Config file path
4. Current working directory (fallback)

### 3. Init Root Command
- Implement `init_root` MCP tool for runtime configuration
- Store root configuration in memory for session
- Useful for switching projects within same session

### 4. Config File Support
- Support `.scopecraft/config.json` in home directory
- Allow multiple project definitions
- Each project has name and root directory

### 5. Use MCP Roots When Available
- Check if client provides roots capability
- Use `roots/list` to get allowed directories
- Validate project root against allowed roots

## Todo List
- [x] Search for MCP protocol documentation on configuration methods
- [x] Investigate Cursor's MCP server spawning behavior
- [x] Research Claude Desktop's limitations with project confusion
- [x] Find examples of MCP servers with multi-project support
- [x] Document configuration methods supported by each client
- [x] Identify best practices for root directory handling
- [x] Create comparison matrix of client capabilities

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of each client's configuration capabilities
- ‚úÖ Identified limitations and workarounds for each IDE
- ‚úÖ Documented best approach for implementing root overrides
- ‚úÖ List of supported configuration methods per client
- ‚úÖ Recommendations for implementation approach

## Implementation Log

### 2025-05-18 - Research Completed
- Task status updated to "In Progress"
- Completed systematic research on MCP client behaviors
- Identified current implementation issues
- Developed recommendations for implementation

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Current Problem**: Scopecraft uses `process.cwd()` which fails when MCP servers are spawned from application directories
2. **Best Solution**: Add `--root-dir` CLI parameter support as primary configuration method
3. **Additional Methods**: Environment variables, config files, and runtime init command
4. **Client Support**: Cursor has best multi-project support, Claude Desktop is limited to global configuration
5. **Protocol Limitation**: No per-request root override in MCP protocol itself

## Human Review Required

### Research Findings to Verify
- [ ] Accuracy of MCP "roots" specification understanding
- [ ] Completeness of client behavior documentation
- [ ] Feasibility of proposed implementation approaches
- [ ] Priority order of configuration methods

### Technical Assumptions
- [ ] CLI parameter approach will work with all clients
- [ ] Environment variable support is universally available
- [ ] Init root command is feasible without protocol changes
- [ ] Config file approach is appropriate for multi-project scenarios
