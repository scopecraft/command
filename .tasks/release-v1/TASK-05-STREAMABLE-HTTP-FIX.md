# Fix StreamableHTTP Transport Connection Issues

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

* **What is this bug?** The MCP server implementation using the StreamableHTTP transport from the SDK has issues with connection stability. While the STDIO transport works perfectly, the StreamableHTTP transport is quitting unexpectedly or not maintaining connection with the MCP Inspector.
* **Why is it important?** The StreamableHTTP transport is important for web clients and remote access to the MCP server, while STDIO is limited to local processes.
* **Impact:** Users trying to use the MCP server with web clients or remote connections will experience issues or failures.
* **Reproduction:** Start the server with `bun run dev:mcp:sdk` and notice that it terminates unexpectedly or fails to maintain connections with the MCP Inspector.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

* - [ ] Fix the StreamableHTTP connection issues
* - [ ] Verify stable connection with the MCP Inspector
* - [ ] Ensure all MCP methods work through the StreamableHTTP transport
* - [ ] Update any relevant documentation
* - [ ] Add additional error handling or logging if needed to help diagnose future issues

## Technical Notes üìù

The issue may be related to one of the following:

1. **Promise handling**: The server might be terminating because promises are being resolved/rejected improperly
2. **Event handling**: The server might not be properly handling connection events
3. **Transport configuration**: The StreamableHTTP transport might need additional configuration
4. **Process management**: The process might be exiting due to unhandled errors or lack of event loop activities
