## Review MCP Server Implementation

Review the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation to ensure it functions correctly in both standalone and Roo Commander modes. The MCP server needs to expose all task management capabilities via HTTP for LLM integration.

## Objectives

- Review the current implementation of the MCP server
- Test all MCP handlers for proper operation
- Ensure error handling is consistent and informative
- Verify that the server works in both standalone and Roo Commander modes
- Check MCP method signatures for consistency with CLI commands

## Action Items

- [x] Review `src/mcp/server.ts` for proper HTTP server setup
- [ ] Review `src/mcp/handlers.ts` for proper method implementations
- [ ] Test each MCP method with valid and invalid inputs
- [x] Verify mode detection works correctly via MCP
- [ ] Test startup and shutdown procedures
- [ ] Document any found issues or improvement opportunities
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks for identified issues

## Progress Notes

### Server Setup Review
- The server is properly set up as an HTTP server in `src/mcp/server.ts`
- It handles requests and responses correctly with appropriate error handling
- CORS is properly enabled for all requests
- The server can be configured to run on a custom port

### Mode Detection Verification
- Fixed a critical bug in the MCP server's mode detection
- Previously, the MCP server was hardcoded to only work in Roo Commander mode
- Now it correctly uses `projectConfig` to support both standalone and Roo Commander modes
- Added the ability to force a specific mode with the `--mode` option
- Testing confirmed the server works correctly in both modes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP server starts and responds to requests
- [ ] All core task operations (list, get, create, update, delete) work via MCP
- [ ] Phase operations work via MCP
- [ ] Error handling returns proper response codes and messages
- [ ] Server works correctly in both standalone and Roo Commander modes
