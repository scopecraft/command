## Instruction
Fix the Storybook v9 regex flag errors that are preventing the stories from loading.

### Error Details
```
WARN - ./src/components/v2/SectionEditor.stories.tsx: Invalid regular expression flag. (280:12)
WARN - ./src/components/v2/SectionEditorDemo.stories.tsx: Invalid regular expression flag. (112:12)
```

### Context
- Storybook v9 is being used
- The regex flag errors are likely due to v9 compatibility issues
- Storybook server is running at http://localhost:6006/

### Requirements
1. **Fix the regex errors** in both story files
2. **Verify stories load** in Storybook UI
3. **Keep testing** until all stories work properly
4. **Check other story files** for similar issues

### Common Storybook v9 Issues
- Template literal regex patterns may need escaping
- Multiline regex flags might not be supported
- String interpolation in regex patterns can cause issues

### Success Criteria
- No regex errors in console
- All SectionEditor stories load properly
- Storybook UI at http://localhost:6006/ shows the stories

## Tasks
- [ ] Check SectionEditor.stories.tsx line 280 for regex issue
- [ ] Check SectionEditorDemo.stories.tsx line 112 for regex issue
- [ ] Fix the regex patterns for Storybook v9 compatibility
- [ ] Test that stories load at http://localhost:6006/
- [ ] Check for similar issues in other v2 component stories
- [ ] Verify all stories are working properly

## Deliverable

## Log
- 2025-06-05: 2025-06-05: Fixed regex errors by removing erroneous 'EOF < /dev/null' lines from both story files. The issue was not related to Storybook v9 regex compatibility but rather an accidental addition of shell script syntax at the end of the TypeScript files.
