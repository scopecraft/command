# Create CommandPalette component in Storybook

---
type: feature
status: done
area: ui
---


## Instruction
Implement the CommandPalette component in Storybook based on the design specifications from task 03. This is a STORYBOOK-ONLY implementation - no app integration.

### Design Reference
Review the design deliverable from 08_desg-ui-appr-and-cret-mock-06T for detailed specifications.

### Requirements
1. **Use shadcn/ui Command component** as the base
2. **Two-step flow**: Type selection → Title input
3. **Keyboard navigation** throughout
4. **Atlas theme styling** per design guide

### Component Props
```typescript
interface CommandPaletteProps {
  open: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void
  onTaskCreate: (task: NewTaskData) => void
}

interface NewTaskData {
  title: string
  type: TaskType
  template?: string
  isParent?: boolean
}
```

### Storybook Stories Required
1. **Default** - Closed state
2. **Open** - Type selection view
3. **Title Input** - Second step with title entry
4. **With Keyboard Nav** - Show keyboard interactions
5. **Loading State** - While creating task
6. **Error State** - Validation errors

### Implementation Notes
- Install cmdk if not already available
- Follow Atlas color palette from design
- Implement all keyboard shortcuts (F, B, C, D, T, S)
- Mock the onTaskCreate callback in stories
- NO API integration - just component UI

## Tasks
- [x] Install cmdk library if needed
- [x] Create CommandPalette.tsx component
- [x] Implement two-step flow logic
- [x] Add keyboard navigation handlers
- [x] Apply Atlas theme styling
- [x] Create CommandPalette.stories.tsx
- [x] Add all 6 required story variations
- [x] Test keyboard shortcuts in Storybook
- [x] Add component documentation

## Deliverable
# CommandPalette Component Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Successfully installed `cmdk@1.1.1` in the tasks-ui project
- Package is now available for use

### 2. Created Command Base Component (`command.tsx`)
- Implemented all required shadcn/ui command primitives:
  - Command, CommandDialog, CommandInput, CommandList
  - CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandItem, CommandShortcut
- Follows Atlas theme with CSS variable support
- Fully typed with TypeScript

### 3. Created CommandPalette Component (`command-palette.tsx`)
- Implemented two-step flow: type selection → title input
- Added all task types with icons (Feature, Bug, Chore, Documentation, Test, Spike)
- Keyboard shortcuts working (F, B, C, D, T, S)
- Loading and error states supported
- Props match specification exactly
- Atlas theme styling applied

### 4. Created Storybook Stories (`command-palette.stories.tsx`)
- All 6 required stories implemented:
  1. **Default** - Closed state with button to open
  2. **Open** - Type selection view
  3. **TitleInput** - Second step demonstration
  4. **WithKeyboardNav** - Shows keyboard shortcuts
  5. **LoadingState** - Disabled input with loading indicator
  6. **ErrorState** - Error message display
- Additional **AllTaskTypes** story for interactive demo
- Comprehensive documentation for each story

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface CommandPaletteProps {
  open: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void
  onTaskCreate: (task: NewTaskData) => void
  isLoading?: boolean
  error?: string
}

interface NewTaskData {
  title: string
  type: TaskType
  template?: string
  isParent?: boolean
}
```

### Key Features
- **Two-step flow** with smooth transitions
- **Keyboard navigation** throughout
- **Single-letter shortcuts** for quick type selection
- **Loading states** during async operations
- **Error handling** with visual feedback
- **Atlas theme** integration with proper styling

## Files Created
1. `/tasks-ui/src/components/ui/command.tsx` - Base command component
2. `/tasks-ui/src/components/ui/command-palette.tsx` - Main component
3. `/tasks-ui/src/components/ui/command-palette.stories.tsx` - Storybook stories

## Notes
- This is a STORYBOOK-ONLY implementation as requested
- No API integration included
- Mock callbacks used in stories
- Component is ready for integration into the main app when needed
