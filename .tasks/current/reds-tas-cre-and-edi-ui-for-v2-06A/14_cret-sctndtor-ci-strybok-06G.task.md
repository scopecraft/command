## Instruction
Implement the SectionEditor component in Storybook based on the design specifications. This is a STORYBOOK-ONLY implementation.

### Design Reference
Review the design deliverable from 08_desg-ui-appr-and-cret-mock-06T for section-based editor specifications.

### Requirements
1. **Extract DualUseMarkdown pattern** from reference/document-editor/
2. **Remove AI actions** - keep only core edit functionality
3. **Hover-to-edit** with keyboard shortcuts (E to edit)
4. **Atlas theme styling** per design guide

### Component Props
```typescript
interface SectionEditorProps {
  section: 'instruction' | 'tasks' | 'deliverable' | 'log'
  content: string
  onSave: (newContent: string) => Promise<void>
  readOnly?: boolean
}
```

### Core Functionality
- View mode: Display markdown content
- Hover: Show edit hint [E]
- Edit mode: Textarea with markdown
- Save: Shift+Enter
- Cancel: Escape
- Loading state during save

### Storybook Stories Required
1. **Default** - View mode with content
2. **Hover State** - Show edit affordance
3. **Edit Mode** - Active editing
4. **Saving State** - Loading during save
5. **Read Only** - No edit capability
6. **All Sections** - Show each section type

### Implementation Notes
- Extract only the dual-mode behavior from DualUseMarkdown
- Remove all AI-related code
- Make it fully composable
- Mock the onSave callback with delay
- Use Atlas theme colors and transitions

## Tasks
- [x] Study DualUseMarkdown in document-editor
- [x] Create SectionEditor.tsx component
- [x] Implement view/edit mode toggle
- [x] Add hover state detection
- [x] Implement keyboard shortcuts (E, Shift+Enter, Escape)
- [x] Apply Atlas theme styling
- [x] Create SectionEditor.stories.tsx
- [x] Add all 6 required story variations
- [x] Test keyboard interactions
- [x] Add component documentation

## Component created
**Location**: `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/SectionEditor.tsx`

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Dual-Mode Interface**
   - View mode with markdown rendering
   - Edit mode with auto-resizing textarea
   - Smooth transitions between modes

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `E` - Enter edit mode when hovering
   - `Shift+Enter` - Save changes
   - `Escape` - Cancel editing

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Hover state with border color change and subtle lift effect
   - [E] hint appears on hover
   - Loading spinner during save operations
   - Optimistic updates with error rollback

4. **Atlas Theme Integration**
   - Uses CSS variables: `--terminal-dark`, `--atlas-light`, `--cream`, etc.
   - Consistent with V2 design system
   - JetBrains Mono font throughout
   - Uppercase section headers

## Storybook stories created
**Location**: `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/SectionEditor.stories.tsx`

### Stories Implemented (All 6 Required):

1. **Default** - Shows instruction section with content
2. **HoverState** - Demonstrates the [E] hint on hover
3. **EditMode** - Shows active editing state
4. **SavingState** - Displays loading spinner during save
5. **ReadOnly** - No edit capability demonstration
6. **All Sections** - Individual stories for each section type:
   - InstructionSection
   - TasksSection
   - DeliverableSection
   - LogSection

### Additional Stories:
- **EmptyContent** - Shows placeholder text
- **LongContent** - Tests with extensive markdown
- **MarkdownFormatting** - Demonstrates rich content support

## Interactive demo
**Location**: `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/SectionEditorDemo.stories.tsx`

Created a fully interactive demo showing all four sections working together with:
- Real-time state management
- JSON state viewer
- All sections editable independently

## Technical implementation details
### Component Structure:
```typescript
interface SectionEditorProps {
  section: 'instruction' | 'tasks' | 'deliverable' | 'log'
  content: string
  onSave: (newContent: string) => Promise<void>
  readOnly?: boolean
}
```

### Key Patterns Used:
- React hooks for state management
- useCallback for performance optimization
- useRef for DOM manipulation
- useEffect for side effects and keyboard events
- Automatic textarea height adjustment
- Error handling with content rollback

### CSS Architecture:
- Tailwind utility classes
- CSS-in-JS with cn() helper
- Atlas theme CSS variables
- Responsive and accessible design

## Integration notes
1. **Export Added**: Component exported from `/components/v2/index.ts`
2. **Dependencies**: Uses existing `react-markdown` package
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
4. **Composable**: Can be used independently or as part of larger task editing UI

## Next steps for integration
This component is ready to be integrated into the task creation and editing workflows:
1. Can be used in task detail views
2. Ready for inline editing in task tables
3. Supports all four standard task sections
4. Mock onSave can be replaced with actual API calls

## Testing notes
- Component compiles without TypeScript errors
- All keyboard shortcuts functional
- Hover states working correctly
- Save/cancel operations behave as expected
- Loading states display properly
- Read-only mode prevents all editing
