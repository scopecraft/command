## Instruction
Investigate and fix multiple Storybook issues that are blocking stories from loading properly.

### Issue 1: TaskMetadata Export Error
```
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/v2/MetadataEditor/MetadataEditor.tsx' does not provide an export named 'TaskMetadata'
```

### Issue 2: Router Hook Error in TaskManagementView
```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'navigate' of 'useRouter(...)' as it is null.
    at useNavigate (http://localhost:6006/node_modules/.cache/storybook/...)
    at TaskManagementView (http://localhost:6006/src/components/v2/TaskManagementView.tsx:35:20)
```

### Investigation Requirements
1. **For TaskMetadata issue**:
   - Check if it's a module resolution problem
   - Verify export/import syntax
   - Check if it's a Vite/Storybook bundling issue
   - Consider TypeScript type export differences

2. **For Router issue**:
   - TaskManagementView is using useNavigate from TanStack Router
   - In Storybook context, there's no router provider
   - Need to mock or provide router context for stories

### Success Criteria
- All Storybook stories load without errors
- Components work properly in isolation
- Storybook server at http://localhost:6006/ shows all stories
- Document the root cause and fix for each issue

### Important Notes
- Storybook is running at http://localhost:6006/
- Keep testing until all stories work
- Report detailed findings and fixes in the task

## Tasks
- [x] Investigate TaskMetadata export issue in MetadataEditor
- [x] Identify root cause of the export problem
- [x] Fix the TaskMetadata export/import issue
- [x] Investigate router hook error in TaskManagementView
- [x] Identify why useRouter returns null in Storybook
- [x] Create proper router mocking/provider for Storybook
- [x] Test all fixes at http://localhost:6006/
- [x] Document root causes and solutions
- [x] Verify all V2 component stories load properly

## Deliverable

### Root Causes and Solutions

#### Issue 1: TaskMetadata Export Error
**Root Cause**: TypeScript interfaces need to be imported as type imports when they're only used for type annotations. Vite/Rollup's bundler was unable to resolve the regular import of the interface.

**Solution**: Changed the import statement in MetadataEditor.stories.tsx from:
```typescript
import { MetadataEditor, TaskMetadata } from './MetadataEditor';
```
To:
```typescript
import { MetadataEditor, type TaskMetadata } from './MetadataEditor';
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/MetadataEditor/MetadataEditor.stories.tsx`
- `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/index.ts` (added MetadataEditor export)

#### Issue 2: Router Hook Error in TaskManagementView
**Root Cause**: TaskManagementView uses `useNavigate` from TanStack Router, but in the Storybook context, there's no router provider, causing the hook to return null and throw an error.

**Solution**: Mocked the TanStack Router hooks directly in the story file by overriding the module exports before the component imports them:
```typescript
// Override TanStack Router exports
(TanStackRouter as any).useNavigate = () => mockNavigate;
(TanStackRouter as any).useRouter = () => ({
  navigate: mockNavigate,
  state: { location: { pathname: '/', search: '', hash: '' } },
});
```

**Files Modified**:
- `/tasks-ui/src/components/v2/TaskManagementView.stories.tsx`
- `/tasks-ui/.storybook/preview.tsx` (attempted router mock setup)
- `/tasks-ui/.storybook/main.ts` (added Vite configuration)

### Final Solution: Router Provider Approach

**Best Practice Implementation**: Instead of mocking individual components, implemented a proper TanStack Router provider in Storybook's preview.tsx:

```typescript
// Create a router for Storybook with memory history
const storybookRouter = createRouter({
  routeTree: minimalRouteTree,
  history: 'memory',
  initialLocation: '/',
})

// Router provider decorator
const withRouter = (Story: any) => (
  <RouterProvider router={storybookRouter}>
    <Story />
  </RouterProvider>
);
```

**Benefits**:
- All components now work exactly as they would in the app
- No component-specific mocking needed
- Type-safe navigation behavior
- Easy to maintain and update

### Additional Improvements
- Added mock data to TaskManagementView stories using existing `mockV2SimpleTasks` and `mockV2Subtasks`
- Created additional story variants: WithFilters and EmptyState  
- Improved story documentation with descriptions
- Cleaned up individual component mocks in favor of global router provider
