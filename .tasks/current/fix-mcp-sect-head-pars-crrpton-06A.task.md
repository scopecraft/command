## Instruction
Fix the critical issue where MCP task_create and task_update methods corrupt task files when section content contains ## headers.

When AI agents use mcp__scopecraft__task_update or task_create and include markdown headers (##) in section content, it either:
1. Corrupts the task structure by treating ## as new sections
2. Fails to save the content at all (sections remain empty)

Real example that caused this bug report to have empty sections:
```
mcp__scopecraft__task_create({
  title: "Fix MCP section header parsing corruption",
  type: "bug",
  area: "mcp",
  priority: "high",
  instruction: "Fix the critical issue where MCP task_create and task_update methods corrupt task files when section content contains ## headers.\n\nWhen AI agents use mcp__scopecraft__task_update or task_create and include markdown headers (##) in section content, the parser treats these as new sections, breaking the task structure.\n\nExample of the problem:\n```\nmcp__scopecraft__task_update({\n  id: \"task-id\",\n  updates: {\n    deliverable: \"## Completed Module\\n\\nSome content...\"\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis creates invalid task structure because the parser sees \"## Completed Module\" as a new section.",
  tasks: "- [ ] Add section content sanitization..."
})
```

The above payload resulted in a task file with completely empty sections because the parser failed when encountering the ## headers in the instruction content.

## Tasks
- [x] Add section content sanitization to MCP handlers
- [x] Create utility function to convert ## to ### in section content
- [x] Update task_create handler to sanitize all section inputs
- [x] Update task_update handler to sanitize all section inputs
- [x] Add validation tests for header sanitization
- [x] Test with real-world examples from AI agents (created comprehensive test suite with the exact scenario from bug report)
- [ ] Update MCP documentation with content guidelines

## Deliverable
✅ **COMPLETED**: Implemented comprehensive section header sanitization fix that prevents MCP parser corruption.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created `sanitizeSectionContent()` utility function** (`src/mcp/handlers/shared/validation-utils.ts`)
   - Converts `##` headers to `###` headers using regex pattern `/^##(?!#)/gm`
   - Preserves `###` and `####` headers unchanged
   - Handles null/undefined content safely

2. **Updated MCP option builders** (`src/mcp/handlers/shared/options-builders.ts`)
   - `buildTaskCreateOptionsBase()`: Sanitizes instruction content
   - `buildTaskUpdateOptions()`: Sanitizes all section content (instruction, tasks, deliverable, log)
   - `parseTasksList()`: Sanitizes task list content

3. **Comprehensive test coverage** (`test/unit/mcp/section-sanitization.test.ts`)
   - Tests sanitization function with various scenarios
   - Tests integration with option builders
   - Includes real-world scenario from original bug report
   - All 13 tests passing

### Technical Details
- The fix operates at the MCP handler level, intercepting all section content before it reaches the core parser
- Uses a precise regex that only converts `##` at the beginning of lines, avoiding false positives
- Applied consistently across both `task_create` and `task_update` operations
- No breaking changes to existing API
