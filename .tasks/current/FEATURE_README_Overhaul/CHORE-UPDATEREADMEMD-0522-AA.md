## Overview

The current README.md needs a major overhaul to better serve our user-facing audience. The project is transitioning from an internal tool to a public developer tool, and our documentation needs to reflect this shift.

## Problem Statement

Current README issues:
- Doesn't differentiate between user features vs internal development tooling
- Lacks clear value proposition for developers
- Missing proper onboarding flow
- No clear separation between CLI usage and MCP integration
- Development setup mixed with user guidance

## Proposed Structure

### User-Focused Sections (80% of README):
1. **Overview** - What is Scopecraft Command and why should developers care?
2. **Installation** - Quick setup for CLI and MCP
3. **Core Features** - Task management + AI integration
4. **Usage** - CLI commands and MCP workflows
5. **Configuration** - Project setup and customization
6. **Advanced Usage** - Complex workflows and best practices

### Development Sections (20% of README):
7. **Development** - Contributing, setup, architecture
8. **License & Credits**

## Success Criteria

- Clear value proposition within first 3 lines
- Developer can get started in under 5 minutes
- Separate paths for CLI-only vs AI-integrated usage
- Professional appearance suitable for public project
- Links to comprehensive documentation

## Research References

- Claude Task Master: https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master
- Developer tool patterns from CLI tools like Vercel, Stripe CLI
- Focus on 'developer tool' vs 'framework' messaging

## Initial Research Tasks

- [ ] Audit current README.md structure and content
- [ ] Analyze competitor READMEs (Claude Task Master, Chatwoot, Vercel CLI)
- [ ] Identify gaps in current user onboarding flow
- [ ] Document user vs developer content separation needs

## Final Assembly Tasks

- [ ] Integrate all sections into cohesive README
- [ ] Ensure consistent tone and messaging throughout
- [ ] Test installation and quick start instructions
- [ ] Review for grammar, clarity, and professionalism
- [ ] Get team review and approval before publication
