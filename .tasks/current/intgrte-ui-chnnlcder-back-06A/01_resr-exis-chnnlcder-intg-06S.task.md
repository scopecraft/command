## Instruction
Research the existing channelcoder integration patterns in the codebase to understand how to properly connect the UI to backend session management.

### Focus Areas
1. **CLI Integration Patterns**: How dispatch-commands.ts and work-commands.ts use channelcoder
2. **Session Management**: How sessions are created, tracked, and monitored
3. **API Patterns**: What methods are available for UI integration
4. **State Management**: How session state is handled and persisted
5. **Error Handling**: How errors and session failures are managed

### Key Files to Analyze
- src/integrations/channelcoder/client.ts
- src/integrations/channelcoder/session-storage.ts
- src/integrations/channelcoder/monitoring.ts
- src/cli/commands/dispatch-commands.ts
- src/cli/commands/work-commands.ts
- tasks-ui/server/autonomous-handlers.ts

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze channelcoder client.ts for available API methods
- [ ] Study session-storage.ts for state management patterns
- [ ] Review monitoring.ts for session tracking approaches
- [ ] Examine dispatch-commands.ts for session creation patterns
- [ ] Check work-commands.ts for simple session management
- [ ] Review autonomous-handlers.ts for existing UI integration
- [ ] Document API surface area and integration patterns
- [ ] Identify gaps between CLI and UI integration needs

## Deliverable
**Integration Patterns Document**

A comprehensive analysis of how to integrate the UI with channelcoder, including:
- Available API methods and their signatures
- Session lifecycle management patterns
- State persistence and monitoring approaches
- Error handling strategies
- Recommended integration approach for UI components
- Gaps that need to be addressed for proper UI integration
