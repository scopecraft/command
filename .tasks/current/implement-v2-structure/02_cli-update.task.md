## Instruction
Update the CLI commands to work with the new workflow-based structure. Remove phase operations and update task commands for the new system.

**IMPORTANT**: This plan is not complete. Start by reviewing all CLI commands and their implementations. Consider:
- Which commands become obsolete?
- What new commands do we need?
- How do existing workflows change?
- What about command aliases and shortcuts?
- How do we handle command deprecation gracefully?
- Don't hesitate to ask questions about user experience decisions.

### Initial Scope (to be expanded)
1. Remove phase commands entirely
2. Map feature commands to parent tasks
3. Add new filtering options
4. Update task commands for workflow operations
5. Update help text and documentation

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/cli/commands.ts`
- `src/cli/entity-commands.ts`
- Related command implementations

## Deliverable
### Completed Integration (2025-05-28)

1. **Removed Phase System**
   - Commented out phase command setup in entity-commands.ts
   - Phase commands no longer available in CLI

2. **V2 Initialization**
   - `sc init` now creates v2 workflow structure (backlog/current/archive)
   - Creates QUICKSTART.md with v2 guidance
   - Updated help text to explain workflow-based organization

3. **Task Creation with V2**
   - `sc task create` now uses v2 core functions
   - Tasks created in `.tasks/backlog/` by default
   - New ID format: descriptive-MMDD-XX (e.g., test-v2-task-creation-0528-8P)
   - Properly creates v2 document structure with sections

4. **Task Listing with V2**
   - `sc task list` uses v2 listTasks function
   - Added workflow location filters:
     - `--backlog` - Show only backlog tasks
     - `--current` - Show only current tasks
     - `--archive` - Show only archived tasks
     - `--location <state>` - Filter by specific workflow state
   - Updated formatter to show workflow location and proper status/type emojis

### Still To Implement

- Task move/workflow transitions (promote, archive commands)
- Workflow command shortcuts
- Full command testing suite

### Update Command Working (2025-05-28)

The `task update` command is now working with v2:
- `sc task update <id> --title "New title"`
- `sc task update <id> --assignee "username"`
- `sc task update <id> --status "In Progress"`
- `sc task start <id>` - Shortcut to mark as In Progress
- `sc task complete <id>` - Shortcut to mark as Done
- `sc task block <id>` - Shortcut to mark as Blocked

Known issue: Status values with spaces are being truncated (see To Investigate section)

### Get Command Working (2025-05-28)

The `task get` command is now working with v2:
- `sc task get <id>` - Shows task details in default format
- `sc task get <id> --format json` - Output as JSON
- `sc task get <id> --format markdown` - Show full markdown
- `sc task get <id> --format full` - Show all sections including deliverable and log

The command now uses v2 getTask and formatTaskDetail functions.

### Delete Command Working (2025-05-28)

The `task delete` command is now working with v2:
- `sc task delete <id>` - Deletes a task by ID
- Proper error handling for non-existent tasks
- Cannot delete parent task overviews directly (must delete entire folder)

All basic CRUD operations are now complete with v2!

### Parent Commands Working (2025-05-28)

The parent task commands (replacement for features) are now working:
- `sc parent create --title "Feature name" --type feature` - Creates parent task folder with _overview.md
- `sc parent list` - Lists all parent tasks with workflow filters
- `sc parent get <id>` - Shows parent task details and subtasks
- `sc parent add-subtask <parent-id> --title "Subtask"` - Adds subtask to parent
- `sc parent move <id> <target>` - Moves parent task between workflow states
- `sc parent delete <id>` - Deletes parent task and all subtasks

Note: There's a bug where subtasks aren't being loaded in parent get command - needs investigation.

## To investigate
Non-blocking issues found during implementation:

1. **Missing template initialization in v2** (2025-05-28)
   - V1 `initializeTemplates()` copies 6 templates to .tasks/.templates/
   - V2 `initializeV2ProjectStructure()` creates the directory but doesn't copy templates
   - Impact: Users won't have starter templates available
   - Options: Reuse v1 function, create v2-specific templates, or document as known limitation

2. **Remove "v2" from all function names** (2025-05-28)
   - Currently using names like `formatV2Tasks`, `createTaskV2Adapter`, etc.
   - Bad practice to version function names - should just be `formatTasksList`, `createTask`
   - Only the temporary file names should have v2 to avoid conflicts during migration
   - TODO: Rename all functions when replacing v1 with v2

3. **Status update truncation issue** (2025-05-28)
   - When updating status to "In Progress", it's being saved as "Progress"
   - Appears to be truncating at first space
   - Need to investigate v2 update function or YAML serialization
   - Impact: Status values with spaces are not being saved correctly

4. **Init command not using v2 handler** (2025-05-28)
   - `sc init` shows v1 output despite init-v2.ts handler existing
   - The handleInitV2Command is set up but not being called
   - V1 handleInitCommand in commands.ts may be taking precedence
   - Impact: Users get v1 structure instead of v2 workflow structure

5. **Subtasks not loading in parent get command** (2025-05-28)
   - Parent task overview loads correctly but subtasks array is empty
   - Subtask file exists: 01-design-login-form-ui.task.md
   - Core issue: `getParentTask` returns empty subtasks array
   - Root cause: `getTask(projectRoot, subtaskId)` can't resolve subtask IDs
   - CLI needs core to properly load subtasks with their metadata
   - **RESOLVED**: Core team fixed this - getParentTask now properly loads subtasks

6. **Task adoption fails with "Failed to get adopted task"** (2025-05-28)
   - Command: `sc task adopt test-promotion-task-05C test-05A --after design-05C`
   - Error: "Failed to get adopted task" 
   - The adoptTask function seems to complete but fails when trying to get the adopted task
   - Possible issues:
     - The adopted task ID might be changing during adoption (adding sequence prefix)
     - The getTask function might not be finding the newly adopted subtask
     - There might be a timing issue or the file isn't being created correctly
   - Impact: Users cannot adopt floating tasks into parent tasks
   - Workaround: None currently - needs core team investigation
