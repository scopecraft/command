# Update MCP Server for V2 Structure

## Instruction

Update the MCP server handlers to work with the new workflow-based structure. Remove phase operations and update all handlers for the new system.

**IMPORTANT**: This plan is not complete. Start by reviewing all MCP handlers and tool definitions. Consider:
- Which tools need to be removed vs repurposed?
- How do we maintain compatibility with existing Claude prompts?
- What new tools might be needed?
- How does error handling change?
- What about tool descriptions and documentation?
- Don't hesitate to ask questions about API design decisions.

### Initial Scope (to be expanded)
1. Remove phase-related MCP tools
2. Update feature tools to work with complex tasks
3. Update task tools for new structure
4. Add workflow state support
5. Update filtering capabilities

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/mcp/handlers.ts`
- `src/mcp/types.ts`
- Tool descriptions and schemas

## Tasks

- [ ] Remove all phase_* tool handlers
- [ ] Update feature_* tools to work with complex task folders

- [ ] Test all MCP operations

## Deliverable
