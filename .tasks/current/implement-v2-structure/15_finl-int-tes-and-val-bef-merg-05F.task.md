## Instruction
Perform comprehensive integration testing of the complete V2 system before merging to main. Validate that all components work together seamlessly and that the migration from V1 to V2 is complete and successful.

## Tasks
### Full System Testing
- [ ] Test CLI with V2 workflow commands end-to-end
- [ ] Test MCP server with all V2 handlers
- [ ] Test UI with complete task management workflows
- [ ] Test Claude assistant integration if backend is working
- [ ] Verify all data flows work correctly

### Cross-Component Integration
- [ ] Test CLI → MCP → UI data consistency
- [ ] Verify task operations work across all interfaces
- [ ] Test parent/subtask management across components
- [ ] Validate workflow state transitions
- [ ] Check that all V2 features work together

### Performance and Reliability
- [ ] Run performance tests on V2 system
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Verify memory usage is acceptable
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Validate data persistence

### Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with V2 release notes
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is accurate
- [ ] Clean up any temporary files or comments
- [ ] Verify no TODO or FIXME comments remain
- [ ] Run final code quality checks

### Migration Validation
- [ ] Verify no V1 code remains in active paths
- [ ] Test that existing V1 data can be read by V2
- [ ] Validate backward compatibility where needed
- [ ] Ensure clean project structure

### Pre-Merge Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Ready for production use

## Deliverable
Completed comprehensive integration testing and root cause analysis:
- Tested 38 operations across CLI and MCP (58% pass rate)
- Created 4 detailed test reports in project root
- Performed deep root cause analysis for all major issues
- Created 6 subtasks to fix identified problems
- Saved analysis in parent task folder: root-cause-analysis.md

## Log
- 2025-06-02: 2025-06-02: Completed comprehensive E2E testing of CRUD API refactoring
- Test plan and results: /Users/davidpaquet/Projects/roo-task-cli/.tasks/current/implement-v2-structure/e2e-test-log.md
- Tested 30 operations (15 ops × 2 interfaces)
- Results: 22 passed, 0 failed, 8 partial (CLI missing), 1 not tested
- Fixed 3 critical bugs during testing:
  - Init command expecting result object
  - MCP resequence not calling core method
  - Promote operation response handling
- All MCP operations now working correctly
- Remaining issues are CLI-only (tracked in task fix-ci-sub-cre-par-lis-mov-06A)
- 2025-06-03: Starting comprehensive integration testing - reviewing existing test results and planning next steps
- 2025-06-03: 2025-06-02: Completed comprehensive integration testing of V2 system:
- Created fresh test environment in .test-v2-integration
- Tested 38 operations across CLI and MCP (58% pass rate)
- Found critical bugs: MCP filtering broken, metadata not persisting
- Found medium issues: CLI parent commands missing, TypeScript errors
- Created detailed test reports: integration-test-report.md, mcp-test-report.md, consistency-test-report.md
- Created summary: final-integration-test-summary.md
- Key blockers for merge: MCP filter bugs, metadata persistence, TypeScript errors
- 2025-06-03: 2025-06-03: Completed root cause analysis and created 6 fix subtasks:
- 17: Fix MCP location filter (critical)
- 18: Fix MCP type/tag filters (critical)
- 19: Fix metadata persistence (high)
- 20: Implement CLI parent commands (medium)
- 21: Fix CLI subtask creation (high)
- 22: Fix CLI tag handling (low)
