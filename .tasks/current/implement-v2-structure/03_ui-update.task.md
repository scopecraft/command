## Instruction
Build a new V2 Task UI using a UI-first approach with mock providers. Replace the old phase/feature structure with the new workflow-based system. Create fresh V2 components rather than fixing existing ones.

**UPDATED APPROACH**: After analysis, we're using mock providers for Storybook to enable true UI-first development. This allows us to design components and iterate on data structures without defining APIs upfront. React Query can be added later as an optimization.

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create mock V2 providers for Storybook development
2. Build new V2 components using mock providers (UI-first)
3. Design data structures based on UI needs
4. Define API contracts only after UI stabilizes
5. Replace mock with real implementation in Phase 3
6. Consider React Query later if needed for performance

### Key Principles
- **UI-first development** - Design drives data, not vice versa
- **Mock providers for Storybook** - No API definitions needed upfront
- **Don't fix old components** - Build V2 fresh
- **Type-safe with V2 types** - Use imported core types throughout
- **Progressive migration** - Old and new can coexist

## Tasks
### Phase 0: Storybook Groundwork (1-2 days)
- [x] Set up Storybook in tasks-ui project
- [x] Configure Storybook with Tailwind styles and essential addons
- [x] Create story for filter-panel (pure component)
- [x] Create stories for other pure components (TaskContent, TaskMetadata, Breadcrumb, Toast)
- [x] Establish component development pattern (story-first)

### Completed Analysis & Planning
- [x] Review entire tasks-ui codebase for impact analysis
- [x] Document all components that reference phases
- [x] Document all API calls that need updating
- [x] Update TypeScript types to match new structure
- [x] Create comprehensive migration analysis document
- [x] Update implementation plan with Storybook-first approach
### Phase 1: Core Components (Rename Old, Build New)
- [x] Rename TaskContext.tsx ‚Üí TaskContext.old.tsx
- [x] Create new TaskContext with MockTaskProvider for Storybook
- [x] Build ParentTaskCard component with Storybook stories
- [x] Build SubtaskList component with sequence/parallel examples

- [x] Build TaskTypeIcon component (üìÅ vs üìÑ)
- [x] Build TaskTable component with search and filtering
- [x] Build SearchInput component
- [x] Build TaskManagementView (complete table + search + filter experience)
- [x] Build SimpleTaskDetailView showcase (validate all needed components)
- [x] Build SubtaskDetailView showcase (validate subtask-specific needs)
- [ ] Design data structures through UI development
- [ ] Fix broken imports as you go

### Phase 2: Pages & Navigation (Replace Entire Sections)
- [ ] Rename old pages to .old.tsx (PhaseDetailPage, FeatureDetailPage, etc.)
- [ ] Build WorkflowPage (shows tasks by workflow state)

### Phase 3: API Integration & Real Implementation
- [ ] Define API contracts based on UI needs from Phase 1-2
- [ ] Create real TaskContext implementation (replace mock)
- [ ] Update MCP endpoints to match UI requirements
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test integration between UI and backend
- [ ] Remove all .old.tsx files once migration complete
- [ ] Consider adding React Query if caching/optimization needed
### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop subtask reordering (with Storybook interaction testing)
- [ ] Implement parallel task management UI:
  - [ ] Visual indicators for parallel tasks (same sequence)
  - [ ] Bulk selection for making tasks parallel
  - [ ] "Insert task here" buttons between sequences
- [ ] Enhanced task conversion UI:
  - [ ] "Extract to Task" option for subtasks
  - [ ] Confirmation dialogs for conversions
- [ ] Advanced subtask display features:
  - [ ] Sequence number display with edit capability
  - [ ] Group parallel tasks visually
  - [ ] Quick actions for sequence operations
- [ ] Integration testing and polish
- [ ] Storybook documentation for V2 design system
