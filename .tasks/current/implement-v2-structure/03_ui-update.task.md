## Instruction
Build a new V2 Task UI using a UI-first approach with mock providers. Replace the old phase/feature structure with the new workflow-based system. Create fresh V2 components rather than fixing existing ones.

**UPDATED APPROACH**: The MCP server is complete and production-ready. We can now adapt our UI to work with the existing MCP endpoints rather than designing new APIs. The mock providers were useful for Phase 1 design, but we can move directly to real implementation.

### Implementation Strategy
1. ‚úÖ Create mock V2 providers for Storybook development (Phase 1)
2. ‚úÖ Build new V2 components using mock providers (Phase 1)
3. Adapt UI to work with completed MCP API endpoints (Phase 3)
4. Build API client layer to connect to MCP server
5. Replace mock providers with real implementation
6. Document any gaps where MCP changes might be beneficial

### Key Principles
- **UI-first development** - Design drives data, not vice versa
- **Mock providers for Storybook** - No API definitions needed upfront
- **Don't fix old components** - Build V2 fresh
- **Type-safe with V2 types** - Use imported core types throughout
- **Progressive migration** - Old and new can coexist

## Tasks
### Phase 0: Storybook Groundwork (1-2 days)
- [x] Set up Storybook in tasks-ui project
- [x] Configure Storybook with Tailwind styles and essential addons
- [x] Create story for filter-panel (pure component)
- [x] Create stories for other pure components (TaskContent, TaskMetadata, Breadcrumb, Toast)
- [x] Establish component development pattern (story-first)

### Completed Analysis & Planning
- [x] Review entire tasks-ui codebase for impact analysis
- [x] Document all components that reference phases
- [x] Document all API calls that need updating
- [x] Update TypeScript types to match new structure
- [x] Create comprehensive migration analysis document
- [x] Update implementation plan with Storybook-first approach
### Phase 1: Core Components (Rename Old, Build New) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Rename TaskContext.tsx ‚Üí TaskContext.old.tsx
- [x] Create new TaskContext with MockTaskProvider for Storybook
- [x] Build ParentTaskCard component with Storybook stories (3 variants)
- [x] Build SubtaskList component with sequence/parallel examples
- [x] Build WorkflowStateBadge component (StatusBadge, PriorityIndicator included)
- [x] Build TaskTypeIcon component (Lucide icons, no emojis)
- [x] Build TaskTable component with search and filtering
- [x] Build SearchInput component
- [x] Build TaskManagementView (complete table + search + filter experience)
- [x] Build ParentTaskDetailPage showcase

- [x] Build ComponentShowcase (overview of all components)
- [x] Export all components in v2/index.ts

### Phase 2: API Integration & Real Implementation (Moved up - do this first!)
- [ ] Review completed MCP API endpoints and adapt UI to match
- [ ] Build API client layer that connects to existing MCP server
- [ ] Create real TaskContext implementation (replace mock)
- [ ] Map UI operations to available MCP functions
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test integration between UI and MCP backend
- [ ] Update showcase stories to use real data (verify components work)
- [ ] Consider adding React Query if caching/optimization needed
- [ ] Document any gaps where MCP team changes might be needed

### Phase 3: Pages & Navigation (Now with real data!)
**IMPORTANT**: Use the showcase views in V2Showcase.stories.tsx as templates for these pages!
- [ ] Rename old pages to .old.tsx (PhaseDetailPage, FeatureDetailPage, etc.)
- [ ] Build ParentTaskPage using ParentTaskDetailPage showcase as template
- [ ] Build TaskDetailPage using SimpleTaskDetailPage showcase as template
- [ ] Build SubtaskDetailPage using SubtaskDetailPage showcase as template
- [ ] Build DocumentPage using DocumentDetailPage showcase as template
- [ ] Build TaskListView using MixedTaskList/TaskManagementView showcases as template
- [ ] Integrate V2 Sidebar component (already built in Phase 1)
- [ ] Update routing to use new components
- [ ] Remove all .old.tsx files once migration complete
### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop subtask reordering (with Storybook interaction testing)
- [ ] Implement parallel task management UI:
  - [ ] Visual indicators for parallel tasks (same sequence)
  - [ ] Bulk selection for making tasks parallel
  - [ ] "Insert task here" buttons between sequences
- [ ] Enhanced task conversion UI:
  - [ ] "Extract to Task" option for subtasks
  - [ ] Confirmation dialogs for conversions
- [ ] Advanced subtask display features:
  - [ ] Sequence number display with edit capability
  - [ ] Group parallel tasks visually
  - [ ] Quick actions for sequence operations
- [ ] Integration testing and polish
- [ ] Storybook documentation for V2 design system
