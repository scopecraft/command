## Instruction
Build a new V2 Task UI using a UI-first approach with mock providers. Replace the old phase/feature structure with the new workflow-based system. Create fresh V2 components rather than fixing existing ones.

**UPDATED APPROACH**: The MCP server is complete and production-ready. We can now adapt our UI to work with the existing MCP endpoints rather than designing new APIs. The mock providers were useful for Phase 1 design, but we can move directly to real implementation.

### Implementation Strategy
1. ‚úÖ Create mock V2 providers for Storybook development (Phase 1)
2. ‚úÖ Build new V2 components using mock providers (Phase 1)
3. Adapt UI to work with completed MCP API endpoints (Phase 3)
4. Build API client layer to connect to MCP server
5. Replace mock providers with real implementation
6. Document any gaps where MCP changes might be beneficial

### Key Principles
- **UI-first development** - Design drives data, not vice versa
- **Mock providers for Storybook** - No API definitions needed upfront
- **Don't fix old components** - Build V2 fresh
- **Type-safe with V2 types** - Use imported core types throughout
- **Progressive migration** - Old and new can coexist

Created API client with all V2 MCP endpoints, added hooks for tasks/parents/workflow operations, configured 30-second auto-refresh when window visible, integrated filters with TanStack Router search params for URL persistence, fixed filter data mapping for live API responses, and added proper loading/error states. Task management page now shows real-time data with working filters that persist in URL.
- 2025-05-30: Phase 3 routing implementation completed - Implemented dedicated /parents/ routes architecture with parent list, parent detail, and subtask views. Fixed React hooks ordering issue in parent route, added Outlet for proper nested routing, resolved SubtaskList key warnings, integrated supporting documents display from parent_get response with smart type detection. Parent routes now work correctly with /parents/$parentId for parent tasks and /parents/$parentId/$subtaskId for subtasks. Documents widget displays actual files from MCP response.

Created useRecentTasks hook that fetches tasks from current and backlog sorted by updated date, added proper task type normalization for icon display, implemented correct routing for parent vs simple tasks. Also added useWorkflowCounts hook to show dynamic task counts in workflow section. Both hooks use appropriate refresh intervals (1 minute for recent tasks, 2 minutes for workflow counts) and only refresh when window is visible.
- 2025-05-30: Implemented ParentTaskListView - Created dedicated parent task list view that extends TaskManagementView with parent-specific features. Added subtask progress display to TaskTable showing "X/Y subtasks (Z%)" with visual progress bar. Created proper types file defining Task, ParentTask, and TableTask interfaces. Updated parent list route to use new component with search params support. Parent tasks now display with real progress data from the API's include_progress flag.
- 2025-05-30: Fixed Storybook configuration issues - Added CSS import to preview.tsx to restore styling, copied mock-data-v2.ts from v1 for story data, added JetBrains Mono font loading via preview-head.html, configured theme support with @storybook/addon-themes for light/dark mode switching. Also updated root package.json storybook command to point to task-ui-2 to avoid confusion.
- 2025-05-30: Refactored Phase 3 plan - Created separate tasks for task create/edit UI redesign (reds-tas-cre-and-edi-ui-for-v2-05A) and worktree dashboard refactor (refc-work-dash-for-v2-05A). Updated Phase 3 to focus solely on Claude Assistant integration, which should be straightforward since the backend hasn't changed. Created cleanup subtask (06_clen-up-ui-com-aft-api-05H) to track UI normalization work after MCP API consistency fixes.
