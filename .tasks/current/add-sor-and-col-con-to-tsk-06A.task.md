## Instruction
The TaskTable component currently has a static column implementation without sorting or column configuration capabilities. This task involves refactoring the existing table to use TanStack Table and implementing sorting and column configuration features.

## Tasks
- [ ] Install @tanstack/react-table dependency
- [ ] Create TaskTable.stories.tsx story for table with sorting
- [ ] Refactor TaskTable to use TanStack Table
- [ ] Implement column sorting with visual indicators
- [ ] Add URL param persistence for sort state
- [ ] Create story demonstrating column visibility controls
- [ ] Implement column visibility toggle UI
- [ ] Add createdDate and updatedDate columns (hidden by default)
- [ ] Implement localStorage persistence for column preferences
- [ ] Update existing TaskTable stories with new features
- [ ] Test responsive behavior on mobile
- [ ] Update TaskManagementView integration if needed
- [ ] Document sorting and column configuration in stories
- [ ] Cleanup any of the old implementation if applicable

## Deliverable
- Refactored TaskTable component using TanStack Table
- Full sorting support with visual indicators and URL persistence  
- Column visibility configuration with localStorage persistence
- Updated Storybook stories demonstrating all features
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing usage
- Mobile-responsive implementation
- No breaking changes to parent components

- 2025-06-06: === AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION STARTED ===
- Task: add-sor-and-col-con-to-tsk-06A
- Analysis: Feature task in UI area with implementation-ready requirements
- Selected Mode: Implementation Mode
- Reasoning: Well-defined feature with clear technical specifications for TanStack Table integration
- Professional Expertise: Senior React Engineer - focusing on clean architecture and type safety
- 2025-06-06: Architecture Analysis Complete:
- Current: Custom table with hardcoded columns array
- TableTask type is well-defined with all necessary fields
- @tanstack/react-table NOT installed - need to add
- Component already supports selection state - good foundation
- Storybook setup excellent for iterative development

Implementation Plan:
1. Install @tanstack/react-table dependency
2. Refactor to TanStack Table with column definitions
3. Implement sorting with visual indicators
4. Add column visibility controls with localStorage
5. Add URL param persistence for sort state
6. Update all stories to demonstrate features
7. Test mobile responsiveness

✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED:

Core Implementation:
• Installed @tanstack/react-table dependency
• Refactored TaskTable to use TanStack Table with column definitions
• Implemented sorting with visual indicators (ChevronUp/Down/UpDown)
• Added URL parameter persistence for sort state
• Column visibility controls with localStorage persistence
• Date columns (createdDate, updatedDate) hidden by default
• Maintained 100% backward compatibility

Code Quality:
• Fixed all mock data compatibility issues
• Resolved all linting issues and TypeScript errors
• Added proper accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA labels)
• Extracted TableHeaderCell component to reduce complexity
• Used proper TypeScript types throughout

Stories & Documentation:
• Created WithSorting story demonstrating basic sorting
• Created WithColumnConfiguration story showing column controls
• Created WithUrlPersistence story demonstrating URL persistence
• Created FullFeatured story showcasing all capabilities
• Comprehensive documentation in story descriptions

Advanced Features:
• Multi-column sorting with Shift+click
• Sort state persists in URL (shareable/bookmarkable)
• Column preferences persist in localStorage
• Mobile-responsive table with horizontal scroll
• Proper semantic HTML and accessibility

Status: READY FOR TESTING & INTEGRATION

## Requirements
### 1. Sorting Capabilities
- Click column headers to sort ascending/descending/unsorted
- Visual indicators for sort direction (up/down arrows)
- Support sorting by: title, status, priority, area, type, createdDate, updatedDate
- Multi-column sorting with shift+click
- Persist sort preferences in URL params (following existing pattern with Zod validation)

### 2. Column Configuration
- Allow users to show/hide columns via dropdown menu
- Add date columns (createdDate, updatedDate) that are hidden by default
- Save column visibility preferences to localStorage
- Consider column reordering via drag and drop (stretch goal)

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Install and integrate @tanstack/react-table
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing TaskTable props
- Follow Storybook-first development approach
- Ensure responsive behavior on mobile (horizontal scroll)
- Use existing UI components (Button, DropdownMenu) for controls

## Current state
- TaskTable uses a custom implementation with hardcoded columns
- No sorting functionality exists
- Date fields are available in Task schema but not displayed
- Column definitions are already structured in an array
