## Instruction
Synthesize findings from the three parallel research tasks to make key architecture decisions.

Review and integrate:
1. Storage patterns and implications (01_)
2. Storage architecture design (01_)
3. Integration impacts analysis (01_)

Key decisions to make:
- Final directory structure for ~/.scopecraft/projects/
- Work documents organization in repo
- Migration approach (big bang vs gradual)
- Docker and permission handling strategy
- Whether .sessions/ should also migrate

**Related work**: Task refc-env-config-fnctnlcmpsble-06A is refactoring ConfigurationManager/env system and creating regression tests that will be useful for this migration.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review all three research deliverables
- [ ] Review refc-env-config-fnctnlcmpsble-06A for relevant patterns and tests
- [ ] Create decision matrix for key choices
- [ ] Document final architecture decisions
- [ ] Define Phase 2 implementation tasks
- [ ] Identify risks and mitigation strategies

## Deliverable
Architecture Decision Record (ADR) containing:
- Summary of research findings
- Final decisions on all key points
- Rationale for each decision
- Implementation phases
- Risk assessment
- Next phase task definitions
