## Instruction
Design the UI approach for task creation and editing based on research findings. Create mockups that demonstrate the hybrid approach combining DualUseMarkdown patterns for editing with modal/slide-out panels for creation.

### Context from Research Phase:
- DualUseMarkdown component from document-editor prototype provides proven section-based editing
- Hybrid approach recommended: modals for creation, inline for editing
- Must support both simple tasks and parent task orchestration
- Maintain Scopecraft's dark terminal aesthetic

### Design Requirements:
1. **Task Creation Flow**:
   - Quick creation for simple tasks (under 10 seconds)
   - Guided creation for parent tasks with orchestration
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced options

2. **Task Editing Experience**:
   - Section-based editing matching task structure (Instruction, Tasks, Deliverable, Log)
   - Contextual AI actions per section
   - Inline editing with hover actions
   - Auto-save with conflict resolution

3. **Visual Design**:
   - Dark terminal aesthetic from SCOPECRAFT_STYLE_GUIDE.md
   - Consistent with existing V2 components
   - Accessible color contrast and keyboard navigation

4. **Component Architecture**:
   - Shared primitives between task and document editing
   - Reusable section components
   - Flexible layout system

  - Selected Mode: DESIGN
  - Reasoning: Explicit mode:design tag + "Design UI approach" title + mockup creation focus
  - Loading: design/base.md principles for UI/UX design approach
- 2025-06-05: 2025-06-05 14:05: Starting design work. Reviewed:
  - Research findings from document-editor analysis
  - Scopecraft style guide (dark terminal aesthetic)
  - Existing V2 component patterns
  - DualUseMarkdown component structure

  Key decisions:
  - Adopt hybrid approach (modals for creation, inline for editing)
  - Adapt DualUseMarkdown patterns to Scopecraft aesthetic
  - Focus on section-based editing for task structure
- 2025-06-05: 2025-06-05 14:20: Completed comprehensive design package including:
  - Detailed wireframes for all creation and editing flows
  - Component architecture diagram with clear separation of concerns
  - Visual specifications adapted to Scopecraft's dark terminal aesthetic
  - Interaction patterns with keyboard shortcuts and AI integration points
  - Responsive design considerations for all device sizes
  - Accessibility features for inclusive design
  - Implementation guidance for developers
  - Clear design rationale explaining all decisions
- 2025-06-05: 2025-06-05 14:25: Created React component examples demonstrating implementation:
  - QuickCreateModal with Scopecraft styling
  - TaskSection base component with hover actions
  - TaskSectionEditor with dual-mode functionality
  - Full implementation uses Tailwind + shadcn patterns
  - Maintains consistency with existing V2 components
- 2025-06-05: 2025-06-05 14:30: === EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
  - Mode Used: DESIGN
  - Status: COMPLETED
  - Deliverable: READY
  - Questions: None - all design decisions documented
  - Follow-up: Ready for implementation phase (subtask 03)

## 1. wireframes created
### Quick Create Modal
- Simple modal with title, type selector, and quick options
- Progressive disclosure with "Advanced Options" expandable section
- "Create as parent task" checkbox for orchestration flow
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to create, ESC to close)

### Parent Task Creation Flow
- Multi-step wizard for complex task creation
- Three orchestration modes: AI-suggested, Manual, Template-based
- Subtask definition interface with sequencing options
- Visual indicators for parallel vs sequential tasks

### Task Edit View
- Full-page layout with header and four main sections
- Section-based architecture matching task structure
- Hover-activated action panels per section
- Inline metadata editing with dropdown selectors

## 3. visual design specifications
### Adapted to Scopecraft Aesthetic
- Background: terminal-black (#121212)
- Cards: terminal-dark (#1A1A1A) 
- Text: cream (#F2EFE1)
- Accent: atlas-light (#3A8BD1)
- Monospace font: JetBrains Mono
- Dot grid background pattern
- Subtle borders with hover states

### Key Visual Elements
- Modal backdrops with blur effect
- Transform animations on hover (translateY)
- Status badges with uppercase text
- Progress bars for task completion
- Keyboard shortcut indicators

## 4. interaction patterns
### Keyboard Navigation
- Ctrl+K: Quick create
- E: Edit section (hover)
- Shift+Enter: Save edit
- Tab: Navigate sections
- /: Focus search

### AI Integration Points
Per-section contextual actions:
- Instruction: Improve, Extract requirements, Generate criteria
- Tasks: Break down, Suggest tasks, Reorder
- Deliverable: Check completeness, Add metrics
- Log: Summarize, Extract blockers

### Auto-save Behavior
- 2-second debounce
- Visual save indicator
- Conflict resolution UI
- Undo/redo per section

## 5. responsive design
- Mobile: Full-screen modals, stacked metadata
- Tablet: Slide-out panels, two-column metadata
- Desktop: Full layout with hover interactions

## 6. accessibility features
- ARIA labels and regions
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader announcements
- High contrast support
- Reduced motion mode

## 7. implementation guidance
### State Management
- TaskEditState for editing
- TaskCreationState for creation flows
- Zustand for form state
- React Query for MCP operations

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualized lists
- Lazy loaded AI components
- Debounced inputs
- Cached markdown parsing

### Testing Strategy
- Component unit tests
- Flow integration tests
- E2E critical paths
- Visual regression tests

## Design rationale
The hybrid approach balances speed with flexibility:
- Modal creation enables sub-10 second task creation
- Section-based editing preserves document context
- AI actions are contextual to reduce cognitive load
- Dark terminal aesthetic maintains brand consistency
- Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming new users

This design successfully adapts the DualUseMarkdown patterns while addressing Scopecraft-specific needs like workflow states, task relationships, and MCP integration.
