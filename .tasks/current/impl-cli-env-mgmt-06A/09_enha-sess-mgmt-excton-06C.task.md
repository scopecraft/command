## Instruction
Enhance the dispatch command with proper session management and add tmux as a new execution mode, enabling better monitoring and interactive attachment capabilities.

**Important Architecture Context**: This is a CLI MVP implementation that should align with the long-term architecture vision described in:
- `docs/02-architecture/orchestration-architecture.md` - Session types, execution flows, storage patterns
- `docs/01-concepts/mode-system.md` - How modes work, composition mechanism, execution models

While we're not implementing the full service stack, the CLI should follow these patterns to enable smooth migration later.

**Current Problems**:
1. Dispatch uses basic `claude()` instead of session API, making sessions invisible to monitoring
2. No tmux execution option for hybrid detached-but-attachable sessions
3. No continuation support for interrupted dispatch sessions
4. **Architecture violation**: Both work and dispatch commands import directly from 'channelcoder' instead of using the integration layer at `src/integrations/channelcoder/`
5. **Code organization issue**: `claude-command-utils.ts` exists in CLI layer but should be part of integration layer
6. **Critical feature missing**: Mode prompts from `.tasks/.modes/` are not being loaded/injected! The mode parameter is passed but the actual prompt files are ignored.

**Research Phase Requirements** (Do this first!):
1. Study ChannelCoder's session API capabilities:
   - How do session.docker() and session.detached() work?
   - Is there a session.tmux() or similar?
   - How does session continuation work?
   - How to inject prompt files (like the old scripts do with `channelcoder .tasks/.modes/$mode/base.md`)
2. Analyze existing implementations:
   - Review `scripts/auto-autonomous.ts` for session patterns and prompt loading
   - Study `tasks-ui/server/autonomous-handlers.ts` for monitoring integration
   - Examine `tasks-ui/server/claude-session-handlers.ts` for tmux patterns
   - **Important**: Study how `dispatch` script loads mode prompts (line 91)
3. Understand the monitoring UI expectations:
   - Required .info.json structure
   - Session naming conventions
   - Status tracking requirements
4. Review the integration layer:
   - Examine `src/integrations/channelcoder/` structure
   - Understand why it was bypassed in initial implementation
   - Determine if placeholder adapter needs real SDK integration
5. **Review architecture docs**:
   - Understand session types and execution flows from orchestration-architecture.md
   - Study mode composition mechanism from mode-system.md
   - Note storage patterns (runtime vs historical)

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. Architecture Fix:
   - Update dispatch (and work) to use ChannelCoderClient interface
   - Replace placeholder adapter with real ChannelCoder SDK integration
   - Move `WorkMode` type and `buildTaskContext` from `claude-command-utils.ts` to integration layer
   - Delete `claude-command-utils.ts` after moving its contents
   - Ensure all ChannelCoder usage goes through integration layer

2. Mode Prompt Loading (Per mode-system.md):
   - Load mode prompts from `.tasks/.modes/{mode}/base.md` (or appropriate file)
   - Support dynamic guidance composition based on task metadata
   - Inject mode prompts into the Claude session (not just pass mode name)
   - Support 'auto' mode which uses orchestration/autonomous.md router
   - Handle missing mode directories gracefully
   - Combine mode prompt + task instruction + additional prompt properly

3. Session Management (Aligned with orchestration-architecture.md):
   - Use session API through the integration layer
   - Create .info.json files in `.tasks/.autonomous-sessions/` (runtime state)
   - Support --continue flag for resuming sessions
   - Ensure monitoring UI compatibility
   - Follow unified session model patterns

4. Tmux Execution Mode:
   - Add 'tmux' as third --exec option (docker|detached|tmux)
   - Create named tmux sessions/windows (scopecraft:{taskId}-{mode})
   - Integrate with session management
   - Provide attach instructions

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Integration layer: Update to use real SDK, not CLI commands
- Move all Claude-related types and utilities to integration layer
- Mode prompts: Must be loaded and injected per mode-system.md patterns
- Session naming: Use pattern from auto-autonomous.ts
- Storage: Follow hybrid model (runtime in ~/.scopecraft/, historical in .tasks/)
- Tmux naming: Consider UI server's approach (scopecraft session)
- Error handling: Graceful fallbacks for missing tmux/modes
- Docker integration: Ensure session.docker() works properly

**MVP Scope Clarification**:
- This is a CLI-only implementation, not the full service stack
- But it should follow the architecture patterns to enable future migration
- Use integration layer as a simplified "service boundary"
- Session management stays in CLI for now, but with clean interfaces

- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-08 12:00: === AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION STARTED ===
  - Task: 09_enha-sess-mgmt-excton-06C
  - Analysis: type:feature, area:cli, focus on session management and tmux
  - Selected Mode: implementation
  - Reasoning: Feature implementation with clear technical requirements
  - Loading: implementation mode guidance for CLI area
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-08 12:10: Research phase completed. Key findings:
  - ChannelCoder uses session API with interactive/detached/docker methods
  - Mode prompts loaded from .tasks/.modes/{mode}/base.md via channelcoder CLI
  - Session info stored as JSON in .tasks/.autonomous-sessions/
  - Integration layer exists but unused - commands import channelcoder directly
  - claude-command-utils.ts should be moved to integration layer
  - Need to implement proper SDK usage, not CLI wrapper
2025-06-08 12:15: Starting architecture fix:
  - Move WorkMode type and buildTaskContext to integration layer
  - Update ChannelCoderClient interface with session methods
  - Add mode prompt loading capabilities
  - Fix direct channelcoder imports in commands
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-08 12:30: Implementation phase completed. Major accomplishments:
  - Moved WorkMode type and buildTaskContext to integration layer
  - Created comprehensive utils.ts with mode prompt loading
  - Updated ChannelCoderClient interface with session methods
  - Implemented executeDetached, executeTmux, continueSession methods
  - Fixed architecture violations - all commands use integration layer
  - Deleted claude-command-utils.ts
  - Added session info JSON generation for monitoring
  - Integrated mode prompt loading from .tasks/.modes/
  - Added tmux execution with proper session/window naming

2025-06-08 12:35: === EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
  - Mode Used: implementation
  - Status: COMPLETED (with testing remaining)
  - Deliverable: READY (core functionality)
  - Questions: 0
  - Follow-up: Testing tasks remain but core implementation done
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-08 12:40: Discovered API mismatch. ChannelCoder SDK documentation shows:
  - session() creates session objects with claude/stream/interactive methods
  - claude() function accepts docker/worktree options directly
  - No separate docker() or continue() methods on session
  - Detached mode via detached: true option on claude()
  - Need to refactor implementation to match actual API
- 2025-06-08 12:45: Fixed session adapter to use correct ChannelCoder API:
  - executeDocker: Now uses s.claude() with docker options
  - executeDetached: Now uses s.claude() with detached: true
  - continueSession: Now uses session.load()
  - All methods properly inject mode prompts as first argument
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and unused variables
  - Code now compiles cleanly (except unrelated formatter complexity)
  - NOTE: Implementation complete but NOT TESTED
