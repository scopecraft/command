## Instruction
Create a Technical Requirements Document that defines the implementation approach for the CLI commands. This bridges the gap between what we're building (PRD) and how we'll build it.  

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze existing CLI structure and patterns
- [ ] Define module architecture and boundaries
- [ ] Specify core interfaces and types
- [ ] Document dependency choices with rationale
- [ ] Create implementation guidelines
- [ ] Define testing approach
- [ ] Review with technical stakeholders

## Deliverable
Technical Requirements Document (cli-commands-trd.md) containing:
- Architecture diagrams
- Module structure
- Core interfaces
- Dependency specifications
- Implementation guidelines
- Testing strategy

## Log
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08: TRD task created following PRD approval

## Key areas to define
1. **Architecture Placement**
   - Where each command fits in the codebase structure
   - Module boundaries and dependencies
   - Integration with existing CLI framework

2. **Dependencies**
   - @inquirer/prompts for interactive selection
   - ChannelCoder SDK integration approach
   - Any other required libraries

3. **Core Function Signatures**
   - Environment resolution interface
   - Command handler patterns
   - Shared utility functions

4. **Implementation Patterns**
   - Error handling strategy
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and debugging approach

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test approach for utilities
   - Integration test patterns
   - Mock strategies for external dependencies

## Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Commander.js structure
- Should follow existing CLI patterns in codebase
- Leave room for implementers to make decisions
- Focus on interfaces, not implementation details
