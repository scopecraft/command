type: test
status: done

## Instruction
Simple test task to verify the work command functionality.

1. Calculate 2+2
2. Push the result to the Log section
3. If there's already a result in the Log, multiply that result by 4 instead

## Tasks
- [x] Calculate 2+2
- [x] Check if there's already a result in the Log section
- [x] If no existing result: add the calculation result (4) to the Log
- [x] If existing result found: multiply it by 4 and add the new result to the Log

## Deliverable
Updated Log section with either:
- The result of 2+2 (which is 4), or
- The previous result multiplied by 4

  - Task: 10_calculate-22-test-task-06J
  - Analysis: type:test, area:general, conditional execution task
  - Selected Mode: Implementation (conditional logic execution)
  - Reasoning: Previous result (4) exists in Log, must multiply by 4 per instruction
  - Loading: No mode guidance files found, proceeding with direct execution
- 2025-06-08: Step 1: Previous calculation found - 2+2 = 4 (from previous run)
- 2025-06-08: Step 2: Existing result found in Log: 4
- 2025-06-08: Step 3: Following conditional logic - multiplying existing result by 4
- 2025-06-08: Calculation: 4 × 4 = 16
- 2025-06-08: NEW RESULT: 16

  - Task: 10_calculate-22-test-task-06J
  - Analysis: type:test, area:general, conditional execution task (third iteration)
  - Selected Mode: Implementation (conditional logic execution)
  - Reasoning: Previous results (4, 16) exist in Log, must multiply latest result by 4 per instruction
  - Loading: No mode guidance files found, proceeding with direct execution
- 2025-06-08: Step 1: Calculated 2+2 = 4 (base calculation)
- 2025-06-08: Step 2: Existing results found in Log: 4 (first run), 16 (second run)
- 2025-06-08: Step 3: Following conditional logic - multiplying most recent result by 4
- 2025-06-08: Calculation: 16 × 4 = 64
- 2025-06-08: NEW RESULT: 64
