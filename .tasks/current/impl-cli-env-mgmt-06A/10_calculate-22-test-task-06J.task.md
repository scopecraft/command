## Instruction
Simple test task to verify the work command functionality.

1. Calculate 2+2
2. Push the result to the Log section
3. If there's already a result in the Log, multiply that result by 4 instead

## Tasks
- [x] Calculate 2+2
- [x] Check if there's already a result in the Log section
- [x] If no existing result: add the calculation result (4) to the Log
- [ ] If existing result found: multiply it by 4 and add the new result to the Log

## Deliverable
Updated Log section with either:
- The result of 2+2 (which is 4), or
- The previous result multiplied by 4
