     - Task: 04_implmnt-shar-env-utils-06U
     - Analysis: type:feature, area:cli, tags include 'architecture', 'core', 'typescript'
     - Selected Mode: implementation
     - Reasoning: Clear implementation task with specific technical requirements
     - Loading: implement/autonomous.md, implement/area/cli.md, implement/area/core.md, guidance/architecture-patterns.md
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 09:57: Reviewed TRD document - comprehensive specifications available
  - Clear module structure: core/environment/, integrations/channelcoder/
  - All interfaces defined with TypeScript
  - Centralized configuration pattern emphasized
  - Architecture aligned with long-term vision
  - Dependencies specified: simple-git, @inquirer/prompts, zod
  
  Planning implementation approach:
  1. Create directory structure
  2. Implement WorktreePathResolver (critical - centralized paths)
  3. Implement WorktreeManager with simple-git
  4. Implement EnvironmentResolver
  5. Create configuration services
  6. Create ChannelCoder integration wrapper
  7. Add error handling
  8. Add unit tests
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 10:02: Created directory structure
  - Created src/core/environment/
  - Created src/integrations/channelcoder/
  
  Next steps:
  - Implement types.ts with all interfaces from TRD
  - Implement WorktreePathResolver (critical - single source of truth)
  - Implement WorktreeManager with simple-git
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 10:07: Implemented core components
  - Created types.ts with all interfaces from TRD
  - Implemented WorktreePathResolver (centralized path logic)
  - Implemented configuration services (BranchNaming, DockerConfig, ModeDefaults)
  - Implemented WorktreeManager using simple-git
  
  Key design decisions:
  - Path pattern ONLY in WorktreePathResolver.getWorktreeBasePath()
  - Branch pattern ONLY in BranchNamingService.getBranchName()
  - All magic values centralized in services
  - WorktreeManager handles git operations reliably
  
  Next: Implement EnvironmentResolver with parent/subtask logic
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 10:12: Completed core implementation
  - Implemented EnvironmentResolver with parent/subtask logic
  - Created index.ts for environment module exports
  - Implemented ChannelCoder integration layer:
    - types.ts with all interfaces
    - session-adapter.ts with placeholder implementation
    - index.ts for exports
  
  Key features implemented:
  - Environment resolution correctly handles parent/subtask logic
  - All paths centralized in WorktreePathResolver
  - ChannelCoder wrapped for future replaceability
  - Error handling with specific error codes
  
  Next: Create unit tests for all components
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 10:18: Created comprehensive unit tests
  - WorktreePathResolver tests: Full coverage of path resolution logic
  - Configuration services tests: All three services tested
  - EnvironmentResolver tests: Parent/subtask logic thoroughly tested
  
  Test highlights:
  - Verified path pattern is ONLY in WorktreePathResolver
  - Tested all edge cases for task ID resolution
  - Mocked external dependencies properly
  - Used Bun test framework with proper mocking
  
  Note: WorktreeManager tests would require complex git mocking,
  leaving for integration tests with real git operations
- 2025-06-08: 2025-06-08 10:25: Fixed test failures and verified implementation
  - Fixed extractTaskIdFromBranch to handle 'task/' edge case
  - Fixed EnvironmentResolver to pass project root to getTask
  - All 49 unit tests now passing
  - Code quality checks pass (bun run code-check)
  
  === EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
  - Mode Used: Implementation
  - Status: COMPLETED
  - Deliverable: READY
  - Questions: 0
  - Follow-up: None needed

## Completed environment utilities module
### Implemented Components

1. **Core Environment Module** (`src/core/environment/`)
   - `types.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces from TRD
   - `worktree-path-resolver.ts` - Centralized path resolution (ONLY place with path pattern)
   - `configuration-services.ts` - Three services for centralized config values
   - `worktree-manager.ts` - Git worktree operations using simple-git
   - `resolver.ts` - Environment resolution with parent/subtask logic
   - `index.ts` - Module exports with factory functions

2. **ChannelCoder Integration** (`src/integrations/channelcoder/`)
   - `types.ts` - Integration interfaces for future replaceability
   - `session-adapter.ts` - Placeholder implementation wrapping ChannelCoder SDK
   - `index.ts` - Module exports

3. **Comprehensive Unit Tests** (`test/unit/core/environment/`)
   - `worktree-path-resolver.test.ts` - 16 tests, full path resolution coverage
   - `configuration-services.test.ts` - 19 tests, all three services tested
   - `resolver.test.ts` - 14 tests, parent/subtask logic validated
   - Total: 49 passing tests with proper mocking

### Key Architecture Achievements

✅ **Centralized Configuration**
- Path pattern ONLY in `WorktreePathResolver.getWorktreeBasePath()`
- Branch pattern ONLY in `BranchNamingService.getBranchName()`
- Docker config ONLY in `DockerConfigService`
- Mode inference ONLY in `ModeDefaultsService`

✅ **Parent/Subtask Logic**
- `EnvironmentResolver` correctly resolves:
  - Subtasks → Parent environment ID
  - Parent tasks → Own ID as environment
  - Simple tasks → Own ID as environment

✅ **Future-Proof Design**
- Domain logic in `core/`, not CLI utils
- External dependency (ChannelCoder) wrapped for replaceability
- Service-oriented interfaces ready for extraction
- Clear error handling with specific error codes

✅ **Project Agnostic**
- Dynamic path resolution: `{projectName}.worktrees`
- Works for ANY project using Scopecraft
- No hardcoded "scopecraft" paths

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript checks pass
- Follows existing patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented with JSDoc comments

### Next Steps
The env command implementation (task 05) can now use these utilities to:
- Resolve environments for any task
- Create/manage worktrees reliably
- Use centralized configuration values

## Key components to implement
1. **EnvironmentResolver** (`src/core/environment/resolver.ts`)
   - Resolve environment ID (parent for subtasks, task ID for parent tasks)
   - Ensure environment exists (create if missing)
   - Get environment info without creating

2. **WorktreeManager** (`src/core/environment/worktree-manager.ts`)
   - Create worktrees with proper naming convention
   - Remove worktrees safely
   - List active worktrees
   - Check existence

3. **WorktreePathResolver** (`src/core/environment/worktree-path-resolver.ts`)
   - Centralized path resolution (CRITICAL: only place with path pattern)
   - Dynamic project-based naming: `{projectName}.worktrees`
   - Works for ANY project, not hardcoded for Scopecraft

4. **Configuration Services**
   - BranchNamingService: Centralized branch patterns
   - DockerConfigService: Docker defaults
   - ModeDefaultsService: Mode inference logic

5. **Integration Layer** (`src/integrations/channelcoder/`)
   - Wrapper for ChannelCoder SDK
   - Adapter interfaces for future replaceability

## Technical requirements
- All path resolution MUST be centralized in WorktreePathResolver
- No magic strings or patterns scattered in code
- Use simple-git for git operations (not shell commands)
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Domain logic in core/, not in CLI utils
- Design for future service architecture
