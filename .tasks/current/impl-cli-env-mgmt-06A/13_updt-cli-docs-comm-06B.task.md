## Instruction
Update the CLI documentation to reflect the new env, work, and enhanced dispatch commands, providing clear usage examples and explaining the composable workflow approach.

**Documentation Requirements**:
1. Update main CLI documentation:
   - Command reference for env, work, dispatch
   - Options and flags for each command
   - Examples of common workflows
   - Integration with existing commands

2. Create workflow guides:
   - Basic task workflow (env → work)
   - Automated execution (dispatch)
   - Parent/subtask workflows
   - Session management patterns

3. Architecture documentation:
   - How commands compose together
   - Environment management approach
   - Session tracking and monitoring
   - Mode system integration

**Existing Documentation**:
- `docs/04-reference/cli.md` - Main CLI reference
- `README.md` - Quick start examples
- Command help text in code

**Key Topics to Cover**:
- Unix philosophy implementation
- Composable command design
- Worktree-based environments
- ChannelCoder integration
- Mode prompt system
- Session management
- Tmux execution option

  - Loading: No mode-specific guidance available, proceeding with implementation approach
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-09 09:47: Completed audit of existing CLI documentation
  - Found existing claude-commands-guide.md (Claude slash commands)
  - Main CLI reference docs/04-reference/cli.md does NOT exist (needs creation)
  - README.md has good CLI examples but missing new commands
  - Analyzed new commands: env (environment management), work (interactive Claude), dispatch (autonomous Claude)
  - Ready to start documentation creation
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-09 09:55: Completed major documentation deliverables
  - ✅ Created docs/04-reference/cli.md - Complete command reference with all entities
  - ✅ Created docs/03-guides/cli-workflows.md - 18 workflow patterns and examples
  - ✅ Updated README.md with new commands (env, work, dispatch) and examples
  - ✅ Updated documentation links section in README
  - Commands documented: task, parent, env, work, dispatch, workflow, template
  - Included composability patterns, session management, troubleshooting
- 2025-06-09: 2025-06-09 09:58: === EXECUTION COMPLETE ===
  - Mode Used: Implementation (documentation creation)
  - Status: COMPLETED
  - Deliverable: READY
  - Questions: None
  - Follow-up: No additional tasks needed
  
  **Summary of Completed Work:**
  - Created comprehensive CLI reference (docs/04-reference/cli.md)
  - Created detailed workflow guide (docs/03-guides/cli-workflows.md) with 18 patterns
  - Updated README.md with new command examples
  - Documented all new commands: env, work, dispatch
