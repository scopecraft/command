## Instruction
Review the PRD document for the new CLI commands and make a decision on the proposed design.

## Key Decision Points

1. **Command Naming**: Approve `env`, `work`, and `dispatch` as command names
2. **Command Structure**: Confirm the separation of concerns is clear
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure migration path is acceptable
4. **Technical Approach**: Validate the use of ChannelCoder SDK and worktree strategy

## Review Criteria

- Commands are intuitive and follow Unix philosophy
- Clear separation between environment management and execution
- Migration path doesn't break existing workflows
- Extensible to future environment types (Docker-only, cloud)

## Required Stakeholders

- Technical Lead (architecture approval)
- Primary Developer (implementation feasibility)
- End Users (usability validation)

- [ ] Read PRD document at cli-commands-prd.md
- [ ] Review command examples and workflows
- [ ] Validate technical approach
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision
- [ ] Document any requested changes
- [ ] Approve final design

## Deliverable
