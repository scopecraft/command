## Instruction
Review the PRD document for the new CLI commands and make a decision on the proposed design.

## Tasks
- [ ] Read PRD document at cli-commands-prd.md
- [ ] Review command examples and workflows
- [ ] Validate technical approach
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision
- [ ] Document any requested changes
- [ ] Approve final design

## Deliverable
PRD approved with no modifications required. Proceed to technical design phase.

## Log
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08: Review gate task created for PRD approval
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08: PRD approved by David. Ready to proceed with technical design (TRD).

## Key decision points
1. **Command Naming**: Approve `env`, `work`, and `dispatch` as command names
2. **Command Structure**: Confirm the separation of concerns is clear
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure migration path is acceptable
4. **Technical Approach**: Validate the use of ChannelCoder SDK and worktree strategy

## Review criteria
- Commands are intuitive and follow Unix philosophy
- Clear separation between environment management and execution
- Migration path doesn't break existing workflows
- Extensible to future environment types (Docker-only, cloud)

## Required stakeholders
- Technical Lead (architecture approval)
- Primary Developer (implementation feasibility)
- End Users (usability validation)
