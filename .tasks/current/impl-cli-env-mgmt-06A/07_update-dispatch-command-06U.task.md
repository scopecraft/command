## Instruction
Update the existing `dispatch` script to integrate with the new environment management system. The dispatch command runs Claude in background/detached mode for autonomous operations.

**Key Documents:**
- PRD: `.tasks/current/impl-cli-env-mgmt-06A/cli-commands-prd.md`
- TRD: `.tasks/current/impl-cli-env-mgmt-06A/cli-commands-trd.md`
- Architecture Review: `.tasks/current/impl-cli-env-mgmt-06A/architecture-review-report.md`

The dispatch command should:
1. Require a taskId (no interactive selection)
2. Use the same environment resolution as work command
3. Support both Docker and detached execution modes
4. Share mode inference logic with work command
5. Provide clear feedback on background execution

This is an update to the existing dispatch functionality, integrating it with the new architecture while maintaining backwards compatibility where possible. Review existing `dispatch` script for context.

## Tasks
- [x] Create dispatch-commands.ts with command handler
- [x] Update entity-commands.ts to register dispatch command
- [x] Integrate with EnvironmentResolver for environment setup
- [x] Share mode inference logic from work command
- [x] Implement Docker execution mode support
- [x] Implement detached execution mode support
- [x] Add execution type validation (docker vs detached)
- [x] Provide clear user feedback for background operations
- [x] Ensure backwards compatibility with existing workflows
- [x] Create integration tests for dispatch scenarios
- [x] Test both Docker and detached execution paths

## Deliverable
Updated `dispatch` command that:
- Integrates seamlessly with new environment system
- Requires taskId (autonomous use case)
- Supports Docker and detached execution modes
- Shares environment resolution with work command
- Shares mode inference logic
- Provides clear feedback on background execution
- Maintains backwards compatibility
- Has proper error handling
- Integration tests for all execution modes
- Ready for CI/CD and automation scenarios

## Log
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08 11:30: Starting implementation of dispatch command
  - Will share code with work command for environment resolution and mode inference
  - Focus on Docker and detached execution modes
  - Autonomous/background execution pattern
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08 11:45: Completed dispatch command implementation
  - Created dispatch-commands.ts with full Docker and detached execution support
  - Registered dispatch command as top-level command with 'd' alias
  - Shares environment resolution logic with work command
  - Shares task context building utilities
  - Fixed mode inference - now uses 'auto' mode by default (Claude decides)
  - Docker execution uses configurable image from DockerConfigService
  - Created comprehensive integration tests
  - Fixed test output to suppress expected errors for cleaner test runs
- 2025-06-08: 2025-01-08 11:45: Completed dispatch command implementation
  - Created dispatch-commands.ts with Docker and detached execution support
  - Registered dispatch command as top-level command with 'd' alias
  - Shares environment resolution logic with work command
  - Uses claude-command-utils.ts for shared utilities
  - Fixed mode handling to use 'auto' by default (Claude decides mode)
  - Created integration tests - all 8 tests passing
  - Code check shows no errors in new files
