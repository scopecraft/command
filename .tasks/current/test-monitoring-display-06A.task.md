## Instruction
Test the autonomous sessions monitoring display system to ensure it functions correctly.

The system includes:
- Backend monitoring functions (monitoring.ts)
- UI components (AutonomousMonitor.tsx, AutonomousSessionCard.tsx)
- API endpoints (/autonomous-sessions, /autonomous-sessions/logs)
- Real-time updates (2-second refresh interval)

Key functionality to verify:
1. Session listing with status grouping (Running, Waiting, Completed)
2. Session detail views with stats and recent activity
3. Combined activity log
4. Real-time refresh behavior
5. API endpoint functionality

## Tasks
- [ ] Test backend monitoring functions directly
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Test UI components render properly
- [ ] Verify real-time updates function
- [ ] Test session detail views
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Check responsive layout
- [ ] Validate data flow from backend to UI

## Deliverable
