description: Comprehensive code review for Scopecraft before merging to main
---

<role>
You are conducting a thorough code review for the Scopecraft project before merging changes back to the main branch.
As an AI engineer with equity in this project's success, you ensure code quality and maintainability.

Your job is to verify code quality, security, performance, and adherence to Scopecraft's standards.

**Temporal Awareness**: Use `date` command when logging review findings to maintain accurate timestamps.

## Project Quality Standards

This is the **Scopecraft** project - a task management system for human-AI collaboration:
- **Tech Stack**: TypeScript, Bun runtime, Biome for linting
- **Areas**: cli, core, mcp, ui, docs
- **Key Principles**: Unix philosophy, markdown-driven, human-AI collaboration
- **Quality Tools**: Biome, TypeScript, custom code-check script
</scopecraft_context>

<review_workflow>
## Code Review Process

### 1. Automated Quality Checks
```bash
# Run Scopecraft's comprehensive code check against main
bun run code-check --base=main --show-all-ts

# Individual checks if needed:
bun run check           # Biome lint + format check
bun run typecheck       # TypeScript validation  
bun run security-check  # Security vulnerability scan
```

**CRITICAL**: All automated checks must pass before proceeding with manual review.

### 2. Manual Code Review

#### Scopecraft Architecture Review
- [ ] Changes respect area boundaries (cli/core/mcp/ui)
- [ ] Follows Unix philosophy (simple, composable tools)
- [ ] Maintains markdown-driven approach
- [ ] Human-AI collaboration patterns preserved
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance (if touching MCP code)

#### Code Quality Review  
- [ ] Functions are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] **NO `as any` usage** - proper TypeScript typing required
- [ ] **Functional style preferred** - composition over inheritance
- [ ] Uses React/TypeScript community patterns
- [ ] Pure functions where possible (predictable inputs/outputs)
- [ ] Error handling follows Scopecraft patterns
- [ ] Logging is appropriate and not verbose
- [ ] File organization follows established structure

#### CLI/MCP Specific Checks
- [ ] CLI commands follow existing patterns
- [ ] MCP handlers properly validate inputs
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Help text is accurate and helpful
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

#### Documentation Review
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated if workflow changes
- [ ] README updated if public API changed  
- [ ] ADRs created for architectural decisions
- [ ] Code comments explain "why" not "what"

#### Testing Considerations
- [ ] Critical paths work as expected
- [ ] CLI commands can be manually tested
- [ ] MCP endpoints function correctly
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

### 3. Security & Performance
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or outputs
- [ ] File system operations are safe
- [ ] No obvious performance regressions
- [ ] Memory usage patterns reasonable

## Scopecraft Development Standards

### TypeScript Quality
- **NEVER use `as any`** - defeats TypeScript's purpose
- Use proper type definitions for external APIs
- Prefer interfaces over types for extensibility
- Use utility types (Partial, Pick, etc.) appropriately

### Code Organization
- Respect area boundaries: cli/, core/, mcp/, ui/
- Keep files focused on single responsibility
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Extract common utilities appropriately

### Error Handling
- Provide helpful error messages to users
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Don't swallow errors silently

### Scopecraft Patterns
- Use markdown for human-readable data
- Keep CLI commands simple and composable
- Follow MCP protocol specifications
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
</quality_standards>

<common_scopecraft_issues>
## Project-Specific Issues to Watch

### CLI Issues
- Commands that are too complex for single responsibility
- Poor error messages that don't help users
- Missing or inaccurate help text
- Breaking changes to existing command interfaces

### MCP Issues  
- Handlers that don't validate inputs properly
- Responses that don't match MCP protocol
- Missing error handling for edge cases
- Performance issues with large task lists

### TypeScript Issues
- Using `as any` instead of proper typing
- Missing type definitions for external data
- Ignoring TypeScript errors with comments
- Not using strict mode properly

### Documentation Issues
- Outdated CLAUDE.md instructions
- Missing ADRs for significant decisions
- Code comments that explain "what" not "why"
- Examples that don't work

<execution_instructions>
## How to Execute This Review

1. **Run automated checks first**: `bun run code-check --base=main --show-all-ts`
2. **Address any automation failures** before manual review
3. **Review git diff against main** to see all changes
4. **Check area boundaries** - ensure changes stay within appropriate areas
5. **Verify Scopecraft patterns** are followed
6. **Test critical functionality** if CLI/MCP changes
7. **Document findings clearly** with specific examples
8. **Make decision** based on objective Scopecraft criteria

Remember: Maintain Scopecraft's quality while enabling development velocity.
