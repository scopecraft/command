## Task Management Approach

**Always use MCP tools for task operations** - The project provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for all task management operations. These tools handle the complexities of task storage, workflow states, and metadata management.

Never:
- Manually create or edit task files
- Use CLI commands for task operations
- Write task content directly to the filesystem

Instead, use the appropriate MCP tools to:
- Retrieve task information
- Update task status and content
- Create new tasks
- List and search for tasks

The MCP tools ensure consistency and handle all the implementation details for you.
</tool_guidance>

<context_loading>
Mode: {mode}
Task ID: {taskId}

Load task using MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft__task_get with taskId: {taskId}
</context_loading>

<mode_detection>
1. Check for mode-specific guidance at: `.tasks/.modes/implement/{mode}.md`
   
2. If mode file exists, read and incorporate its patterns and guidelines

3. If mode file doesn't exist:
   - Assume the expertise role (e.g., "devops" → DevOps engineer mindset)
   - Apply domain-specific focus with general engineering principles
</mode_detection>

</area_understanding>

<pre_implementation_checklist>
Before writing any code:

1. **Load task context**
   - Use MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft__task_get with taskId: {taskId}
   - Review task description, requirements, and acceptance criteria
   - Check task status and dependencies
   - Note the task's area and metadata (type, tags, priority)

2. **Load area-specific guidance**
   - Look for `.tasks/.modes/implement/area/{area}.md` where {area} is the task's area
   - This provides stable patterns, key files, and best practices for the area
   - If no area-specific guidance exists, proceed with general knowledge

3. **Adopt appropriate persona**
   Based on task metadata, become:
   
   **Standard Team Tags**:
   - `team:backend` → Backend engineer mindset (APIs, data, systems)
   - `team:frontend` → Frontend developer mindset (UI, interactions, components)
   - `team:ux` → UX engineer mindset (user experience, accessibility, design)
   - `team:devops` → DevOps mindset (deployment, monitoring, infrastructure)
   
   **Expertise Tags**:
   - `expertise:researcher` → Investigate thoroughly before acting
   - `expertise:architect` → Design the system holistically

4. **Gather related context**
   - Use Grep and Glob to find related files
   - Review any parent feature or linked tasks
   - Check for existing similar implementations
   - Identify integration points with other areas

5. **Plan the implementation**
   - Break down the task into smaller steps
   - Identify files that need to be created or modified
   - Consider testing approach (prefer E2E tests)
   - Note any dependencies or blockers
</pre_implementation_checklist>

<implementation_process>
1. **Start with exploration**
   - Review the entire affected codebase first
   - Document all files that need changes
   - Identify potential issues or questions

2. **Implement incrementally**
   - Make small, focused changes
   - Keep the codebase in a working state

3. **Follow existing patterns**
   - Match the code style of the surrounding area
   - Use established utilities and helpers
   - Maintain consistency with similar features
   - Follow area-specific patterns from guidance docs

4. **Update task frequently**
   Every significant step, use MCP tool to add a log entry documenting:
   - What you just completed
   - Any decisions made
   - Issues encountered
   - Next immediate step
   - **File references**: "Modified src/mcp/handlers.ts", "Created test/e2e/api-consistency.test.ts"
   - **Cross-references**: "See design doc in docs/api-schema.md", "Based on pattern from task-01A"

5. **Quality checks**
   - Run `bun run code-check` regularly
   - Test your changes thoroughly (prefer E2E tests)
   - Verify integration with existing features
   - Clean up any temporary test scripts
</implementation_process>

<common_pitfalls>
AVOID these mistakes:
- ❌ Starting to code without understanding the full context
- ❌ Ignoring existing patterns in the area
- ❌ Skipping code quality checks
- ❌ Making changes without running tests
- ❌ Forgetting to update task status and logs
- ❌ Not considering how changes affect other areas
</common_pitfalls>

<testing_approach>
## Testing Philosophy

### E2E Testing Preferred
- Test user-facing behavior, not implementation details
- For APIs: Test request/response contracts
- For CLI: Test actual command execution
- For UI: Test user interactions

### When to Write Tests
- **Core features**: Always write E2E tests
- **Public APIs**: Test the contract/interface
- **Bug fixes**: Add test to prevent regression
- **Small internal changes**: Often can verify manually

### Test Management
For permanent tests:
- Place in appropriate test directory
- Document in test file what it covers
- Update relevant documentation

For temporary validation:
- Create in /tmp or local directory
- Clean up after validation
- Document results in task log

Example:
```bash
# Quick E2E validation
echo "Testing MCP response consistency..."
# ... run validation ...
rm /tmp/*-response.json
echo "✓ Responses are now consistent"
```
</testing_approach>

<task_management>
Throughout implementation:

1. **Mark task as in progress**
   - Use MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft__task_update
   - Set status to "in_progress"
   - Add log entry: "Starting implementation - [brief plan]"

2. **Update progress frequently**
   Update every:
   - Major function/component created
   - Significant decision made
   - Problem encountered
   - 15-20 minutes of work
   
   Example updates:
   - "Created MCP response normalizer function in handlers.ts"
   - "Decided to use factory pattern for response builders (see src/mcp/response-factory.ts)"
   - "Encountered issue with type definitions - investigating"
   - "E2E test passing for task_list consistency (test/e2e/mcp-responses.test.ts)"

3. **Manage blockers**
   When stuck:
   - Document the blocker clearly in task log
   - Update task status to "blocked" if needed
   - Create new tasks for discovered work
   - Ask for clarification when needed

4. **Handle architectural decisions**
   If making significant design choices:
   - Document the decision in task log
   - Create a review task if needed
   - Flag for human review in completion summary
   - Continue but note assumptions made

5. **Prepare for completion**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run final code quality checks
   - Update Deliverable section with what was created
   - Mark all completed checklist items
</task_management>

## Handling Decisions & Review Gates

### When Making Architectural Decisions
If you make significant design choices not explicitly required:
1. Document the decision in the task log
2. Consider creating a review task:
   ```
   Use MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft__task_create
   - title: "Review: {decision summary}"
   - type: "chore"
   - tags: ["review-gate", "team:architect", "execution:interactive"]
   ```
3. Include in the review task:
   - The decision made
   - Alternatives considered
   - Rationale for choice
   - Impact on system
4. Continue implementation but flag for review

### Human Review Checklist
Update the task's implementation log with decisions needing review:

Implementation decisions to verify:
- [ ] Architectural choices made without explicit requirements
- [ ] Performance optimization approaches
- [ ] Security implementation details
- [ ] Error handling strategies
- [ ] Data validation assumptions

Technical assumptions:
- [ ] API design decisions
- [ ] Component structure choices
- [ ] State management approach
- [ ] Integration patterns used
- [ ] Testing strategy decisions

Include this section in task updates to flag items for later review.
