# Add Specialized Development Flow Commands

## Description

Enhance the development workflow by creating specialized Claude commands that guide users through a structured feature development process. This will improve consistency, reduce context loss between sessions, and ensure proper documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

## Background

The current task system is lightweight and implementation-focused. We need to add commands that:
1. Guide through feature proposal â†’ PRD â†’ planning â†’ execution
2. Create proper breadcrumbs for future Claude sessions
3. Leverage existing task system (phases, features, areas, tasks)
4. Provide specialized guidance for different technical domains

## Implementation Approach: Hybrid Strategy

Based on analysis, we'll use a hybrid approach balancing maintainability with performance:

### Specialized Commands (Major Workflow Differences)
- `/project:01_brainstorm-feature` - Generate initial feature ideas (Step 1)
- `/project:02_feature-proposal` - Create formal proposal with requirements (Step 2)  
- `/project:03_feature-to-prd` - Transform proposal into detailed PRD (Step 3)
- `/project:04_feature-planning` - Create comprehensive task breakdown (Step 4)

These have fundamentally different purposes and require distinct prompts. The numeric prefix ensures users follow the workflow in the correct order.

### Generic Commands with Modes (Technical Variations)
- `/project:implement typescript TASK-123` - Core development tasks
- `/project:implement ui TASK-123` - UI/UX implementation
- `/project:implement mcp TASK-123` - MCP server implementation
- `/project:implement cli TASK-123` - CLI feature implementation
- `/project:test TASK-123` - Testing strategy and implementation
- `/project:integrate TASK-123` - Cross-area integration work

These share common patterns but need domain-specific guidance.

### Implementation Example

```markdown
# /project:implement command structure

<task>
You are implementing a task. Load domain-specific guidance based on the mode.
</task>

<mode_detection>
Mode requested: $ARGUMENTS
Extract mode (first word) and task ID (remaining).
</mode_detection>

<load_guidance>
Based on mode, incorporate domain-specific patterns:
- typescript: Focus on type safety, core logic patterns
- ui: Use Scopecraft UI components, terminal aesthetic
- mcp: Follow MCP protocol, tool patterns
- cli: Command structure, argument parsing
</load_guidance>

```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
1. **Reduced duplication** for similar workflows
2. **Specialized commands** where truly different
3. **Extensible** - easy to add new implementation modes
4. **Maintainable** - shared logic in one place
5. **Clear user experience** - logical command groupings

## Requirements

### System Knowledge All Commands Need

1. **Core Understanding**:
   - Task hierarchy and relationships
   - MCP tools prefix: `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__*`
   - Organizational structure (see Organizational Structure Guide)
   - Phases are project/release milestones, NOT task statuses

2. **File Locations**:
   - Templates: `/docs/templates/`
   - Documentation: `/docs/`
   - Commands: `/.claude/commands/`
   - Command Resources: `/docs/command-resources/`
   - Organizational Guide: `/docs/organizational-structure-guide.md`

3. **Conventions**:
   - Task ID format: `TASK-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
   - Always use MCP tools, not CLI
   - Create breadcrumbs for context
   - Understand phases vs statuses distinction
   - Always update task logs and checklists
   - Use numeric prefixes for ordered workflow commands

### Organizational Structure Guidelines

1. **Phases**: Project/release milestones (v1, v1.1, backlog, brand-refresh)
   - High-level project organization
   - Similar to MDTM's phase concept
   - Used for release planning and prioritization
   
2. **Statuses**: Task lifecycle stages (planning, implementation, testing, review, done)
   - Track individual task progress
   - Different from phases - this is task-level workflow
   
3. **Features**: User-facing capabilities that can span areas
   - Deliverable units of functionality
   - May contain multiple tasks across different statuses
   - Assigned to specific phases for release planning
   
4. **Areas**: Major functional domains
   - `cli` - Command-line interface
   - `mcp` - MCP server and AI integration
   - `ui` - Web interface (tasks-ui)
   - `core` - Core task management logic
   - `docs` - Documentation
   - `devops` - Build, deployment, testing
   - `orchestrator` - Work coordination and parallel task management
   
5. **Tasks**: Specific, actionable work items
   - Atomic units of work
   - Have both a phase (release) and status (progress)
   - Belong to an area and potentially a feature

   - Corrected examples in feature-development-workflow.md
   - Enhanced create-command.md to mention numeric prefixes

**Rationale:** Numeric prefixes ensure users follow the workflow in the correct order, reducing confusion about command sequence.

### 2025-05-18 - Brainstorm Command Critical Enhancement

**Completed:**
1. Revised `01_brainstorm-feature` command to be more critical and challenging:
   - Changed task description from helpful assistant to "critical-thinking brainstorming partner"
   - Updated interaction style to be direct and intellectually honest
   - Added aggressive challenge formats (Critical Question, Challenge, Red Flag)
   - Revised example session to demonstrate skeptical questioning
   - Added pushback on assumptions and "nice to have" features
   - Included demands for evidence and specific numbers
   - Questions whether problems are genuine or just inconveniences
   - Challenges solution-looking-for-problem thinking

2. Key changes to example dialogue:
   - Opens with challenge: "That's pretty vague. Are you actually forgetting..."
   - Questions actual cost: "What's the actual cost of not having this?"
   - Demands specifics: "How often is 'sometimes'? Once a week? Once a month?"
   - Challenges workflow: "That might be a workflow problem, not a software problem"
   - Questions habits: "So you can't maintain a simple habit, but you think adding a feature will magically solve this?"
   - Calls out YAGNI principle
   - Suggests alternative solutions (changing habits)
   - Notes when addressing symptoms vs root causes

**Rationale:** The brainstorm command was too agreeable and treated all ideas as valuable. The revised version acts as a true technical advisor who challenges assumptions, questions perceived problems, and ensures only genuinely valuable features get built.

### 2025-05-18 - Brainstorm Command Requirements Focus

**Completed:**
1. Further refined `01_brainstorm-feature` to prevent drift into technical implementation:
   - Changed role from "technical advisor" to "requirements analyst"
   - Added CRITICAL directive to stay focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
   - Updated Phase 2 to focus on user value instead of technical complexity
   - Revised Phase 3 to emphasize user perspective and success criteria
   - Removed all technical implementation references from examples
   - Added "Requirements Focus" format for redirecting technical discussions

2. Key changes throughout:
   - Replaced "technical complexity" with "user benefit"
   - Changed "implementation" language to "requirements" language
   - Added redirect patterns for when users drift into technical details
   - Updated example options to describe outcomes, not implementations
   - Revised output format to focus on success criteria and constraints
   - Emphasized measurable outcomes over technical considerations

**Rationale:** User testing showed the command was drifting into technical implementation details. The requirements-focused version ensures brainstorming stays at the appropriate conceptual level, leaving implementation details for later phases.

**Next Steps:**
- Create test feature to validate workflow
- Add mode-specific implementation guides
- Create test and integrate commands
- Test command flow end-to-end
- Update existing commands to new patterns

## Notes

- Commands should be aware of context limitations and create breadcrumbs
- Each command should reference relevant documentation and templates
- Specialized commands should integrate with existing UI patterns and conventions
- Focus on creating a smooth workflow from ideation to implementation
- Commands must understand the organizational structure correctly:
  - Phases = project/release milestones (v1, v1.1, backlog)
  - Statuses = task lifecycle (planning, implementation, done)
  - Areas = technical domains
  - Features = user-facing capabilities
- Generic commands need robust argument parsing for mode detection
- Consider future extensibility when designing mode system
- Always update task logs and checklists to maintain context across sessions
- Human review sections prepare for future orchestrator with human-in-the-loop
- Meta command created to help create future commands systematically
- Workflow commands use numeric prefixes for clear ordering
