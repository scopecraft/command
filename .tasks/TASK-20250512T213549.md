# Implementation Phase 3: Enhancement and Deployment - React Task UI

## Overview
This task covers the actual implementation of the Enhancement and Deployment phase for the React Task UI application as defined in the Implementation Plan (TASK-20250512T143818). This is NOT a planning task but the actual coding implementation of advanced features and deployment setup.

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Replace mock data with real core library integration
  - [x] Create a Bun HTTP API server that directly imports from MCP core handlers
  - [x] Develop a RESTful API interface for browser compatibility
  - [x] Implement a fetch-based client in the React UI
  - [x] Connect UI components to the new API client
  - [x] Add proper error handling for API operations
- [x] Implement task relationship visualization with React Flow
  - [x] Create interactive graph of task dependencies
  - [x] Allow direct manipulation of relationships in the graph
  - [x] Sync graph changes with the underlying data model
- [x] Add quick editing capabilities from list and graph views
  - [x] Implement inline editing for key task fields
  - [x] Add context menus for common actions
  - [x] Create drag-and-drop interactions for relationship management
- [x] Create toast notifications and basic error handling
  - [x] Implement toast notification system for operation feedback
  - [x] Add error boundaries for component-level error handling
  - [x] Create fallback UI for failed component rendering
- [x] Implement responsive design adaptations
  - [x] Ensure proper rendering on mobile devices
  - [x] Adapt layout for different screen sizes
  - [x] Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [x] Build and deploy with Bun HTTP server
  - [x] Configure build process for production
  - [x] Set up Bun HTTP server for hosting the application
  - [x] Create deployment documentation

- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Performance optimizations

## Integration Strategy

### Moving from Mock to Real Data
The Phase 1 implementation created a mock implementation of the core library client to facilitate initial development without dependencies. In Phase 3, we've implemented a browser-compatible approach using a Bun HTTP API server:

1. **Bun HTTP API Server**: Created a server that imports directly from MCP core handlers
2. **RESTful API Interface**: Developed clean RESTful endpoints for task/phase operations
3. **Browser-Compatible Client**: Created a fetch-based client for the React UI
4. **Consistent Types**: Ensured type definitions match between UI and API responses
5. **Error Handling**: Implemented proper error handling for API operations

### Integration Steps Completed
1. Created a Bun HTTP server that imports from MCP core handlers
2. Developed RESTful API endpoints for all task and phase operations
3. Implemented a fetch-based API client for the React UI
4. Updated UI components to use the new API client with error handling
5. Added loading states, error boundaries, and fallback UI components
6. Created API integration test script to verify functionality
7. Updated documentation and added build/deployment scripts

## Implementation Log

### API Integration
- Created `server.ts` with RESTful API endpoints that map to MCP handlers
- Implemented browser-compatible API client in `core-client.ts`
- Added proper error handling in all API requests
- Ensured type safety throughout client-server communication

### API Endpoints and Parameter Handling
- Implemented the following RESTful endpoints:
  - `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks with optional filtering
  - `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get a specific task
  - `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update an existing task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task
  - `GET /api/tasks/next` - Get the next recommended task
  - `GET /api/phases` - List phases
  - `POST /api/phases` - Create a new phase
  - `GET /api/workflow/current` - Get current workflow state
  - `POST /api/workflow/mark-complete-next` - Mark task as complete and get next task
- Added boolean parameter conversion for proper query parameter handling
  - Converted `include_content=true` string query parameter to boolean
  - Converted `include_completed=true` string query parameter to boolean
- Implemented data structure normalization to handle nested API responses
  - Transformed API response objects with format `{metadata: {...}, content: "..."}` 
  - Converted to flat format expected by UI components: `{...metadata, content: "..."}`

### Error Handling & UI Improvements
- Enhanced error boundary components for graceful degradation
- Created fallback components for task list and detail views
- Implemented toast notification system for user feedback
- Added loading states to all UI components
- Added error handling for API failures with user-friendly messages

### Data Structure and Response Processing
- Ensured TaskContext correctly processes API responses for consistent UI display
- Fixed task content display issue by properly handling nested data format
- Created response mapping layer to normalize API response structures
- Added data transformation for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Ensured relationship graph components properly display task connections

### Testing & Optimization
- Created API test script to verify integration
- Updated package.json with build and deployment scripts
- Documented API endpoints and integration strategy in README
- Ensured consistent error handling across all components
- Added server-side parameter validation for reliable API requests

### Deployment Configuration
- Added scripts to the root package.json for running the UI server
- Created production build configuration for the Bun server
- Ensured proper static file serving from the correct directory
- Fixed path resolution issues for running the server from the project root
