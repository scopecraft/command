## Integration Strategy

### Moving from Mock to Real Data
The Phase 1 implementation created a mock implementation of the core library client to facilitate initial development without dependencies. In Phase 3, we've implemented a browser-compatible approach using a Bun HTTP API server:

1. **Bun HTTP API Server**: Created a server that imports directly from MCP core handlers
2. **RESTful API Interface**: Developed clean RESTful endpoints for task/phase operations
3. **Browser-Compatible Client**: Created a fetch-based client for the React UI
4. **Consistent Types**: Ensured type definitions match between UI and API responses
5. **Error Handling**: Implemented proper error handling for API operations

### Integration Steps Completed
1. Created a Bun HTTP server that imports from MCP core handlers
2. Developed RESTful API endpoints for all task and phase operations
3. Implemented a fetch-based API client for the React UI
4. Updated UI components to use the new API client with error handling
5. Added loading states, error boundaries, and fallback UI components
6. Created API integration test script to verify functionality
7. Updated documentation and added build/deployment scripts

## Implementation Log

### API Integration
- Created `server.ts` with RESTful API endpoints that map to MCP handlers
- Implemented browser-compatible API client in `core-client.ts`
- Added proper error handling in all API requests
- Ensured type safety throughout client-server communication

### API Endpoints and Parameter Handling
- Implemented the following RESTful endpoints:
  - `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks with optional filtering
  - `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get a specific task
  - `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update an existing task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task
  - `GET /api/tasks/next` - Get the next recommended task
  - `GET /api/phases` - List phases
  - `POST /api/phases` - Create a new phase
  - `GET /api/workflow/current` - Get current workflow state
  - `POST /api/workflow/mark-complete-next` - Mark task as complete and get next task
- Added boolean parameter conversion for proper query parameter handling
  - Converted `include_content=true` string query parameter to boolean
  - Converted `include_completed=true` string query parameter to boolean
- Implemented data structure normalization to handle nested API responses
  - Transformed API response objects with format `{metadata: {...}, content: "..."}` 
  - Converted to flat format expected by UI components: `{...metadata, content: "..."}`

### Known UI Bugs

1. **Quick Edit Popover Transparency Issue**
   - **Description:** The Quick Edit popover in the task list has transparency issues, making it difficult to read its content. The transparency also causes the popover to sometimes interact with elements behind it.
   - **Components Affected:** 
     - `QuickEditMenu.tsx` - Main popover container component
     - `QuickEditStatus.tsx` and `QuickEditPriority.tsx` - Child components
   - **Root Cause:** CSS styling issue where the popover background is not fully opaque
   - **Proposed Solution:** Update the CSS class for the QuickEditMenu to ensure it has a solid background color and proper z-index to prevent interaction with elements below it

2. **Relationship Graph Layout Issue**
   - **Description:** Task nodes in the relationship graph are clustered together at the top of the graph with poor positioning, making the visualization difficult to use and understand.
   - **Components Affected:**
     - `RelationshipGraph.tsx` - Main graph component
     - `TaskNode.tsx` - Node representation component
     - `GraphPage.tsx` - Page container for the graph
   - **Root Cause:** The initial positioning algorithm for nodes is using a simplistic hash-based approach that doesn't properly distribute nodes. The CSS layout for the graph container may also not be properly set for full-screen display.
   - **Proposed Solution:** 
     - Implement a better node positioning algorithm using ELK.js (Eclipse Layout Kernel)
     - ELK.js is actively maintained and has direct React Flow integration
     - Configure layout with appropriate spacing parameters for task nodes
     - Ensure the graph container has the correct height and width (100% of available space)
     - Add proper spacing between nodes during initial layout
     - Ensure the `fitView` property is working correctly with proper padding

3. **Markdown Typography Styling Not Applied**
   - **Description:** Markdown content in task descriptions is correctly transformed into HTML elements with appropriate tags (h2, p, etc.) and prose classes, but the Tailwind Typography styling is not being visually applied, resulting in plain unstyled markdown content.
   - **Components Affected:**
     - `TaskContent.tsx` - Component that renders the markdown content
     - `tailwind.config.js` - Configuration for Tailwind and its plugins
     - CSS build pipeline
   - **Root Cause:** While the @tailwindcss/typography plugin is correctly installed and configured in tailwind.config.js, the prose styles aren't being properly applied to the markdown content.
   - **Proposed Solution:**
     - Verify that the Tailwind Typography plugin is being properly loaded during build
     - Check for CSS specificity issues that might be overriding the prose styles
     - Ensure proper class inheritance in the parent containers
     - Add more specific typography classes (e.g., `prose-headings:font-bold prose-p:text-base`)
     - Consider adding custom styles for dark mode with proper color contrast

4. **Phase Navigation Not Integrated with API**
   - **Description:** The phase navigation in the sidebar is using static, hardcoded phase data instead of dynamically fetching and displaying phases from the API.
   - **Components Affected:**
     - `Sidebar.tsx` - Contains hardcoded phase buttons with static data
     - `PhaseContext.tsx` - Contains API integration code that's not being utilized
   - **Root Cause:** The API integration code for fetching phases exists in the PhaseContext but is commented out in the Sidebar component (lines 90-111), which currently uses hardcoded phase data instead.
   - **Proposed Solution:**
     - Uncomment and update the dynamic phase list section in Sidebar.tsx
     - Replace the static phase buttons with the dynamically loaded phases
     - Update the phase click handler to use the actual phase IDs from the API
     - Add loading indicators and error handling for phase loading
     - Ensure phase selection is persisted across page navigation
     - Add functionality to the "New Phase" button in the sidebar

### Error Handling & UI Improvements
- Enhanced error boundary components for graceful degradation
- Created fallback components for task list and detail views
- Implemented toast notification system for user feedback
- Added loading states to all UI components
- Added error handling for API failures with user-friendly messages

### Data Structure and Response Processing
- Ensured TaskContext correctly processes API responses for consistent UI display
- Fixed task content display issue by properly handling nested data format
- Created response mapping layer to normalize API response structures
- Added data transformation for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Ensured relationship graph components properly display task connections

### Testing & Optimization
- Created API test script to verify integration
- Updated package.json with build and deployment scripts
- Documented API endpoints and integration strategy in README
- Ensured consistent error handling across all components
- Added server-side parameter validation for reliable API requests

### Deployment Configuration
- Added scripts to the root package.json for running the UI server
- Created production build configuration for the Bun server
- Ensured proper static file serving from the correct directory
- Fixed path resolution issues for running the server from the project root
