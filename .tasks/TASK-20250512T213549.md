# Implementation Phase 3: Enhancement and Deployment - React Task UI

## Overview
This task covers the actual implementation of the Enhancement and Deployment phase for the React Task UI application as defined in the Implementation Plan (TASK-20250512T143818). This is NOT a planning task but the actual coding implementation of advanced features and deployment setup.

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Replace mock data with real core library integration
  - Integrate directly with the core library's API
  - Handle filesystem permissions and error states
  - Implement proper error handling for real filesystem operations
  - Add optimistic updates with proper error recovery
- [ ] Implement task relationship visualization with React Flow
  - Create interactive graph of task dependencies
  - Allow direct manipulation of relationships in the graph
  - Sync graph changes with the underlying data model
- [ ] Add quick editing capabilities from list and graph views
  - Implement inline editing for key task fields
  - Add context menus for common actions
  - Create drag-and-drop interactions for relationship management
- [ ] Create toast notifications and basic error handling
  - Implement toast notification system for operation feedback
  - Add error boundaries for component-level error handling
  - Create fallback UI for failed component rendering
- [ ] Implement responsive design adaptations
  - Ensure proper rendering on mobile devices
  - Adapt layout for different screen sizes
  - Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Build and deploy with Bun HTTP server
  - Configure build process for production
  - Set up Bun HTTP server for hosting the application
  - Create deployment documentation

## Reference Documentation
- Component Architecture: TASK-20250512T143812
- Implementation Plan: TASK-20250512T143818
- UX Design Plan: TASK-20250512T143806
- Core Library: /src/core/*

## Deliverables
- Full integration with the real core library (no more mock data)
- Interactive relationship graph showing task connections
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Functioning toast notification system
- Comprehensive error handling
- Ready-to-use application with Bun HTTP server

## Technical Requirements
- Direct imports from core library modules:
  - src/core/task-manager.ts
  - src/core/project-config.ts
  - src/core/task-parser.ts
  - src/core/types.ts
- React Flow for relationship visualization
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Bun HTTP server for deployment
- Performance optimizations

## Integration Strategy

### Moving from Mock to Real Data
The Phase 1 implementation created a mock implementation of the core library client to facilitate initial development without dependencies. In Phase 3, we'll replace this mock implementation with direct integration to the real core library:

1. **Direct Module Imports**: Import functions directly from the core library modules
2. **Type Consistency**: Ensure type definitions match between UI and core library
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for filesystem operations
4. **Permissions**: Handle filesystem permissions issues gracefully
5. **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates with error recovery

### Integration Steps
1. Replace mock API client functions with their real counterparts
2. Adapt error handling to account for real-world edge cases
3. Add proper loading states for async operations
4. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
5. Add proper validation before sending data to core functions
