# Implementation Phase 1: Foundation - React Task UI

## Overview
This task covers the actual implementation of the Foundation phase for the React Task UI application as defined in the Implementation Plan (TASK-20250512T143818). This is NOT a planning task but the actual coding implementation.

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Initialize project with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Configure shadcn UI with terminal-inspired theme
- [ ] Set up project structure according to component architecture
- [ ] Create direct integration with existing core library
- [ ] Implement basic Context providers for state management
- [ ] Create basic layout components (AppLayout, Header, Sidebar, ContentArea)
