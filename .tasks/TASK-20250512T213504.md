# Implementation Phase 1: Foundation - React Task UI

## Overview
This task covers the actual implementation of the Foundation phase for the React Task UI application as defined in the Implementation Plan (TASK-20250512T143818). This is NOT a planning task but the actual coding implementation.

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Initialize project with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Configure shadcn UI with terminal-inspired theme
- [x] Set up project structure according to component architecture
- [x] Create direct integration with existing core library
- [x] Implement basic Context providers for state management
- [x] Create basic layout components (AppLayout, Header, Sidebar, ContentArea)
- [x] Add URL-based navigation with wouter

## Reference Documentation
- Component Architecture: TASK-20250512T143812
- Implementation Plan: TASK-20250512T143818
- UX Design Plan: TASK-20250512T143806

## Deliverables
- Working project setup with core library integration
- Basic navigation structure
- Terminal-inspired theme configuration
- Project structure following the architecture plan
- Context providers for state management
- Layout components
- URL-based routing with browser history support

## Technical Requirements
- Direct imports from core library (see TASK-20250512T143812 for integration approach)
- Terminal-inspired theme using Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Feature-based project organization (see Component Architecture)

## Implementation Log

### Project Setup
- Initialized React project with Vite, TypeScript
- Added Tailwind CSS v4 using the latest configuration approach
- Configured shadcn UI with neutral color palette
- Added terminal-inspired theme in Tailwind config and CSS variables
- Set up path aliases for better imports

### Project Structure
- Created a feature-based folder structure following the component architecture
- Set up directories for UI components, hooks, context, and types
- Organized layout components in their own directory

### Core Library Integration
- Created mock implementation of core library client for initial development
- Set up type definitions that mirror the core library types
- Prepared structure for easy integration with the real core library later

### Context Providers
- Implemented TaskContext for task state management
- Implemented PhaseContext for phase management
- Implemented UIContext for UI state and preferences
- Created a combined provider hierarchy for proper context composition

### Layout Components
- Created AppLayout component for page structure
- Implemented Header with sidebar toggle and dark mode switch
- Created Sidebar with phase navigation
- Implemented ContentArea for main content
- Added Toast component for notifications

### UI Components
- Created HomePage component with main navigation options
- Implemented TaskListView for displaying tasks in a table format
- Added TaskFormView for creating and editing tasks
- Implemented basic form controls with proper styling

### Routing & Navigation
- Added wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Implemented URL-based navigation with browser history support
- Created routes configuration for consistent URL structure
- Connected all components to use the routing system
- Added proper link behavior for task views, form navigation, and phase selection

### Development Experience
- Set up proper error handling for UI operations
- Added TypeScript type safety throughout the application
- Configured proper form submission with validation
- Implemented CSS with component-specific styling

### Next Steps
- Move to Phase 2 implementation - Core Task Management UI
- Enhance task list with filtering, sorting, and search functionality
- Improve task detail view with relationship visualization
- Add proper data synchronization with the core library
