## Overview
A local-only interface for managing Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files with tabular display and CRUD operations.

## Core Functionality
- Display tasks in a tabular format 
- Provide CRUD operations for tasks
- Filter tasks by status, priority, type, and phase
- View task details including metadata and content
- Edit task properties and content
- Create new tasks with required metadata
- Delete tasks with confirmation

## Technical Requirements
- Local-only application (never hosted on a server)
- Integration with existing core functions from src/core/
- Follow MDTM specification for task organization
- Electron-like environment support for future use

## UI Requirements
- Clean, minimal interface focused on tasks
- Display task status, priority, ID, title and other metadata
- Clear visual indicators for task status
- Filtering capabilities
- Scopecraft style guide with terminal-inspired aesthetic

## Out of Scope
- User authentication/login
- Server-side processing
- Complex routing/navigation
- Multi-user collaboration features
