# React Task Management UI

## Overview
A local-only interface for managing Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files with tabular display and CRUD operations.

## Implementation Tasks
This feature has been broken down into the following phases:

1. **Planning Phase Tasks:**
   - Research: TASK-20250512T143755 (Completed)
   - UX Planning: TASK-20250512T143806 (Completed)
   - Component Architecture: TASK-20250512T143812 (Completed)
   - Implementation Plan: TASK-20250512T143818 (Completed)
   - Final Summary: TASK-20250512T143823 (To Do)

2. **Implementation Phase Tasks:**
   - Phase 1 - Foundation: TASK-20250512T213504 (Completed)
   - Phase 2 - Core Task Management UI: TASK-20250512T213530 (To Do)
   - Phase 3 - Enhancement and Deployment: TASK-20250512T213549 (To Do)

## Progress Update
Phase 1 (Foundation) has been completed successfully. The following has been implemented:
- Created Vite project with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Configured shadcn UI with terminal-inspired theme
- Set up component architecture and folder structure
- Implemented context providers for state management
- Created core layout components
- Added direct integration with the existing core library

Next steps: Implementation of Phase 2 - Core Task Management UI.

## Core Functionality
- Display tasks in a tabular format 
- Provide CRUD operations for tasks
- Filter tasks by status, priority, type, and phase
- View task details including metadata and content
- Edit task properties and content
- Create new tasks with required metadata
- Delete tasks with confirmation

## Technical Requirements
- Local-only application (never hosted on a server)
- Integration with existing core functions from src/core/
- Follow MDTM specification for task organization
- Electron-like environment support for future use

## UI Requirements
- Clean, minimal interface focused on tasks
- Display task status, priority, ID, title and other metadata
- Clear visual indicators for task status
- Filtering capabilities
- Scopecraft style guide with terminal-inspired aesthetic

## Out of Scope
- User authentication/login
- Server-side processing
- Complex routing/navigation
- Multi-user collaboration features
