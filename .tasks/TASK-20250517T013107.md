# Treat subtasks (checkmarks) in tasks as todos for AI coding agents

Please fill in with actual feature template (use mcp to get it) and brainstorm/architecture this idea. Include questions for me at the end for your ideas, questions, etc.

# Requirements

- Each title with a list of GFM (github flavored markdown) tasks is available through core as lists of todos.
-

- Must be implemented in cli, mcp (with a good description to guide AI and encourage following the list as a plan)
- MTask UI (please create a separate subtask linked to this one, we need to brain AI).
