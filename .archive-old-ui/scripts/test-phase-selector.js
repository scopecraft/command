To ensure the Phase Selector component functions properly, follow these test procedures:

1. Prerequisites Check:
   - Verify you have at least one feature that exists in multiple phases
   - Verify you have at least one area that exists in multiple phases
   - If you don't have any multi-phase entities, create some for testing

2. URL Phase Parameter Testing:
   - Open a feature/area that exists in multiple phases
   - Test these scenarios:
     a) /features/{id} - Should show all phases
     b) /features/{id}?phase={phaseId} - Should filter to a specific phase
     c) Click different phase buttons - URL should update
     d) Click "Show All Phases" - phase param should be removed

3. Context Preservation Testing:
   - Select a phase in the sidebar
   - Navigate to a feature/area
   - Verify the phase context is preserved
   - Click on tasks within that feature
   - Verify the phase context is preserved

4. Phase Selector UI Testing:
   - Verify colors match the entity type (blue for features, green for areas)
   - Verify phases appear in correct order by their "order" property
   - Verify phase selector only shows for multi-phase entities
   
5. Task Creation Context Testing:
   - Select a phase in the sidebar
   - Navigate to a feature/area
   - Click "Add Task" button
   - Verify the task creation form pre-selects both the entity and phase

6. Testing Edge Cases:
   - Test behavior when a selected phase has no tasks
   - Test with entities that exist in only one phase (selector shouldn't appear)
   - Test navigation between different entities while maintaining phase context

Implementation components to verify:

1. PhaseSelector Component:
   ✓ Created in /tasks-ui/src/components/entity-group/PhaseSelector.tsx
   ✓ Exported through index.ts
   ✓ Component uses proper entity-specific colors
   ✓ Sorts phases by order property

2. Feature/Area Detail Pages:
   ✓ Added phase selector in FeatureDetailPage.tsx
   ✓ Added phase selector in AreaDetailPage.tsx
   ✓ Reading and updating URL query parameters for phase
   ✓ Filtering displayed phases based on selection
   ✓ "Show All Phases" button when a phase is selected

3. Navigation Context:
   ✓ Updated Sidebar.tsx to preserve phase context
   ✓ Updated EntityGroupSection.tsx for phase-aware navigation
   ✓ Updated "Create Task" buttons to include phase context

4. Verification:
   ✓ Manual testing of all scenarios
   ✓ All tasks in the task list marked as completed
