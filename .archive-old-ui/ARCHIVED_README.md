# ARCHIVED - Old V1 UI

This directory contains the archived V1 UI that was replaced with the new V2 UI implementation.

**Archived on**: 2025-05-31
**Reason**: V1/V2 refactoring - V2 UI (formerly task-ui-2) is now the primary UI in tasks-ui/

## Original Description

This was the original tasks-ui implementation using:
- React with Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI components
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Why Archived

- Replaced with a cleaner V2 implementation
- V2 has better architecture and component organization
- V2 uses TanStack Router instead of React Router
- V2 has improved TypeScript support and API integration

## Note

This directory is kept for reference only and should not be used in production.
The active UI is now in the `tasks-ui/` directory.
