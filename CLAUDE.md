# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Scopecraft Command is a toolset for managing Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files with TOML or YAML frontmatter. It provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, both developed within this project.

The system is designed to be versatile:
- Works both with and without Roo Commander
- Automatically detects project type and adapts accordingly
- Supports the standardized MDTM format
- Provides direct CRUD operations without requiring LLM processing
- Offers the same core functionality through both CLI and MCP interfaces

## Memories

- When creating tasks for testing purpose, always created them in a TEST phase.
