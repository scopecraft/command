# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Scopecraft Command is a toolset for managing Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM) files with TOML or YAML frontmatter. It provides both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, both developed within this project.

The system is designed to be versatile:
- Works both with and without Roo Commander
- Automatically detects project type and adapts accordingly
- Supports the standardized MDTM format
- Provides direct CRUD operations without requiring LLM processing
- Offers the same core functionality through both CLI and MCP interfaces

## Using MCP Tools in Claude Code

**IMPORTANT: When working in Claude Code, always use MCP tools directly instead of CLI commands.**

When working in Claude Code:

- **PREFER MCP TOOLS**: Always use the MCP tools directly (e.g., `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list`, `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_create`) for task operations
- **WHEN TO USE CLI**: Only use CLI commands through Bash for debugging or when specifically requested by the user
- **ERROR HANDLING**: If an MCP tool fails, report the error clearly and don't automatically fall back to CLI

## Local Package Publishing Workflow

After making changes to the codebase and merging to main, follow this workflow to update the local package:

1. Build and package the project:
   ```bash
   npm run publish:local
   ```
   This creates a tarball in ~/MCP/scopecraft/

2. Install the package globally:
   ```bash
   npm run install:local
   ```
   This installs the package globally and verifies CLI commands

3. Verify MCP integration:
   - Claude Code should automatically detect the `scopecraft-cmd` MCP server
   - MCP tools should be accessed using the updated prefix: `mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list`

### MCP Tool Examples

```
// List tasks (content and completed tasks excluded by default to reduce token usage)
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list

// List tasks in a specific phase
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list { "phase": "release-v1" }

// List tasks with full content included (uses more tokens)
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list { "include_content": true }

// List completed tasks (default is to exclude them)
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list { "include_completed": true }

// List all tasks including completed ones with full content (maximum response size)
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list { "include_content": true, "include_completed": true }

// Get details of a specific task
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_get { "id": "TASK-123" }

// Create a new task
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_create {
  "title": "New Feature Task",
  "type": "🌟 Feature",
  "phase": "release-v1"
}

// Update a task status
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_update {
  "id": "TASK-123",
  "updates": {
    "status": "🔵 In Progress"
  }
}

// Get next task recommendation
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_next
```

## Session Guidelines for Claude

When starting a new session with this project, Claude should automatically:

1. Check the current active phases with `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__phase_list`
2. List open tasks using `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list { "status": "🟡 To Do" }`
3. Identify the next highest priority task with `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_next`
4. Ask the user if they want to:
   - Work on the suggested next task (highest priority)
   - Choose a different task from the open tasks list
   - Create a new task for the current phase
   - Create a new phase
   - Do something else entirely

## Architecture

The project is organized into three main modules:

1. **Core Module** (`src/core/`)
   - `types.ts`: Data structures used throughout the application
   - `task-parser.ts`: Parses and formats TOML+Markdown files
   - `task-manager.ts`: CRUD operations for tasks and phases
   - `formatters.ts`: Formats task/phase data for various outputs

2. **CLI Module** (`src/cli/`)
   - `cli.ts`: Main entry point, sets up commands
   - `commands.ts`: Implements CLI commands by calling core functions

3. **MCP Module** (`src/mcp/`)
   - `types.ts`: MCP-specific types for method names and request/response formats
   - `handlers.ts`: Implements MCP method handlers using core functions
   - `server.ts`: HTTP server for processing MCP requests
   - `cli.ts`: CLI entry point for starting the MCP server

## Key Design Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Core logic is separate from interface concerns (CLI and MCP)
- **Consistent Error Handling**: All functions return standardized `OperationResult<T>` type
- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of TypeScript types
- **Task Relationships**: Support for complex task relations (parent-child, dependencies, workflow sequencing)
- **Phase Management**: Organization of tasks into phases

## Task File Format

Tasks are stored as Markdown files with TOML frontmatter:

```md
+++
id = "TASK-AUTH-001"
title = "Implement Authentication"
status = "🔵 In Progress"
type = "🌟 Feature"
priority = "🔼 High"
// ...other metadata
+++

## Task Management Flow

The task management flow follows these principles:

1. **Phases** organize tasks into logical groups (e.g. "release-v1", "milestone-2")
2. **Features & Areas** group related tasks using the MDTM directory structure
3. **Tasks** represent individual units of work with metadata (status, priority, type, etc.)
4. **Workflow** connects tasks through relationships (dependencies, sequential order)
5. **Prioritization** determines which tasks should be completed first

### Flow Steps

1. **Phase Creation**: Create phases to organize related tasks
2. **Feature/Area Creation**: Create subdirectories within phases for logical grouping of related tasks
3. **Task Creation**: Create tasks within phases and features/areas
4. **Task Prioritization**: Assign priorities to tasks (🔥 Highest, 🔼 High, ▶️ Medium, 🔽 Low)
5. **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members
6. **Task Execution**: Work on tasks in priority order
7. **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as done, triggering suggestions for the next task

### Workflow Intelligence

The system intelligently determines the next task based on:
- Task priority (🔥 Highest > 🔼 High > ▶️ Medium > 🔽 Low)
- Task dependencies (tasks that require other tasks to be completed first)
- Phase order (tasks in earlier phases take precedence)
- Explicit task sequences (tasks linked with previous_task/next_task relationships)

### MDTM Directory Structure

The system supports the MDTM directory structure for organizing tasks:

- **Features**: Subdirectories with prefix `FEATURE_*` (e.g., `FEATURE_Authentication`)
- **Areas**: Subdirectories with prefix `AREA_*` (e.g., `AREA_Refactoring`)
- **Overview Files**: Special files named `_overview.md` that describe the feature/area
- **Numbered Tasks**: Optionally, tasks can be named with sequence numbers (e.g., `001_login.md`)

This structure allows for better organization of related tasks. Features typically represent functional parts of the product, while Areas represent cross-cutting concerns.

## Common CLI Commands

```bash
# Basic commands
sc list                                            # List all tasks (short alias)
scopecraft-command list                            # List all tasks (full command)
sc list --status "🟡 To Do"                        # List pending tasks
sc list --phase "release-v1"                       # List tasks in a phase
sc get TASK-ID                                     # Get details of a specific task
sc create --id "TASK-ID" --title "Task title" --type "🌟 Feature" --priority "🔼 High" --phase "release-v1"  # Create a new task
sc create --template "feature" --title "New Feature" --phase "release-v1"  # Create from template
sc update TASK-ID --status "🔵 In Progress"        # Update a task
sc delete TASK-ID                                  # Delete a task

# Status shortcuts
sc start TASK-ID     # Mark as In Progress
sc complete TASK-ID  # Mark as Done
sc block TASK-ID     # Mark as Blocked
sc review TASK-ID    # Mark as In Review

# Phase management
sc phases            # List all phases
sc phase-create --id "phase-1" --name "Planning Phase" --description "Initial planning stage"  # Create a phase

# Template management
sc list-templates    # List available templates

# Workflow navigation
sc next-task         # Find the next highest priority task
sc next-task TASK-ID # Find the next task after completing the specified task
sc mark-complete-next TASK-ID  # Mark a task as complete and show the next task

# Task Content Management
sc get TASK-ID --format full > task.md       # Export task to a file for editing
sc update TASK-ID --file task.md             # Update task from edited file

# Note for AI Assistants (Claude):
# When working with tasks that need substantial content:
# 1. Create the task using CLI commands to establish proper metadata
# 2. Use direct file editing capabilities to update task content in-place
# 3. Skip the export/edit/import workflow when possible for efficiency

# MDTM Directory Structure Commands
sc create --id "_overview" --title "Authentication Feature" --type "🌟 Feature" --phase "release-v1" --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"  # Create a feature overview file
sc create --title "Login UI" --type "🌟 Feature" --phase "release-v1" --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"  # Create a task within a feature
sc list --phase "release-v1" --subdirectory "FEATURE_Authentication"  # List tasks in a feature
sc list --overview  # List only overview files
sc update TASK-ID --subdirectory "FEATURE_UserProfiles"  # Move a task to a different feature

# Note: When completing tasks in Claude Code, follow these steps:
# 1. Update task content to mark checklist items as done [x]
# 2. Add an Implementation Log section with details about the work completed
# 3. Update the task status to "🟢 Done" when all checklist items are complete
```

## Initialization and Setup

Before using the task management system, you need to initialize it:

```bash
# Initialize the task system (autodetects project type)
sc init

# Force specific project mode
sc init --mode standalone  # Uses .tasks directory
sc init --mode roo         # Uses .ruru directory (Roo Commander mode)
```

This creates the necessary directory structure based on the detected or specified project mode:
- `.tasks/` (standalone mode) or `.ruru/tasks/` (Roo Commander mode) for tasks
- `.tasks/config/` or `.ruru/config/` for configuration
- `.tasks/templates/` or `.ruru/templates/` for templates

## MCP Server Usage

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides the same functionality as the CLI but through an HTTP interface optimized for LLMs. **This is the preferred interface when working in Claude Code.**

```bash
# Start the MCP server on default port (3500)
sc-mcp                     # Short alias
scopecraft-command-mcp     # Full command

# Start on a custom port
sc-mcp --port 3501

# Run with verbose mode for debugging
sc-mcp --verbose
```

### MCP Tool Naming Convention

MCP tools in Claude Code follow this naming pattern:
```
mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__method_name
```

For example:
- `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_list` - List tasks
- `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__task_create` - Create a task
- `mcp__scopecraft-command-mcp__phase_list` - List phases

Always use these direct tool references rather than going through the CLI.

### MCP and CLI Implementation Notes

Both interfaces provide the same core functionality but with different characteristics:

1. **MCP Benefits**:
   - Designed specifically for AI integration
   - Structured JSON responses
   - Consistent parameter naming
   - Direct tool integration in Claude Code
   - Better for programmatic access

2. **CLI Benefits**:
   - Human-friendly output format
   - Designed for terminal usage
   - More detailed error messages
   - Useful for manual debugging
   - Better for direct human interaction

3. **Development Considerations**:
   - Both implementations use the same core functions
   - Features should be implemented consistently in both
   - Error handling and validation should be equivalent
   - When fixing bugs, verify in both interfaces
   - When reporting issues, specify which interface exhibited the problem

### MCP MDTM Directory Structure Examples

The MCP server supports all MDTM directory structure features. Here are example requests:

```json
// Create a feature overview
{
  "method": "task_create",
  "params": {
    "id": "_overview",
    "title": "Authentication Feature",
    "type": "🌟 Feature",
    "phase": "release-v1",
    "subdirectory": "FEATURE_Authentication"
  }
}

// Create a task within a feature
{
  "method": "task_create",
  "params": {
    "title": "Login UI Component",
    "type": "🌟 Feature",
    "phase": "release-v1",
    "subdirectory": "FEATURE_Authentication"
  }
}

// List tasks in a feature
{
  "method": "task_list",
  "params": {
    "phase": "release-v1",
    "subdirectory": "FEATURE_Authentication"
  }
}

// List only overview files
{
  "method": "task_list",
  "params": {
    "is_overview": true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Template Parsing Error**:
   - Error: "Failed to parse TOML frontmatter: Missing required field: id"
   - Known issue being tracked in TASK-02-TemplateParseError
   - Workaround: Create tasks without using templates for now

2. **Project Mode Detection**:
   - If wrong mode is detected, use `sc init --mode <mode>` to force mode

3. **Phase Listing Issue**:
   - System directories like 'config', 'templates' might show up as phases
   - Known issue being investigated

### Debugging Tips

- Use `bun run dev:cli -- [command]` for development to see detailed logs
- Use `bun run dev:mcp -- --verbose` for MCP server debugging
- Compare behavior between CLI and MCP interfaces to isolate issues
- Check existence of `.tasks/` or `.ruru/` directories to confirm project mode
- Examine task files directly using a text editor to check for TOML issues
- When reporting issues, specify whether the problem occurs in CLI, MCP, or both
- For MCP-specific issues, check the server logs for JSON-RPC error messages

## MDTM Directory Structure Best Practices

When working with the MDTM directory structure, follow these best practices:

1. **Feature Organization**:
   - Create feature directories using the `FEATURE_` prefix for functional components
   - Create area directories using the `AREA_` prefix for cross-cutting concerns
   - Always create an `_overview.md` file to explain the purpose of the feature/area

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use CamelCase for feature and area names (e.g., `FEATURE_UserAuthentication`)
   - Use lowercase with dashes for task names within features
   - For numbered tasks, use a three-digit prefix (e.g., `001_login-form.md`)

3. **Task Relationships**:
   - Tasks within the same feature should have related tags
   - Consider using the parent-child relationship between the overview and its tasks
   - Use dependencies to represent cross-feature relationships

4. **Organization Example**:
   ```
   .tasks/
     release-v1/
       FEATURE_Authentication/
         _overview.md
         001_login-ui.md
         002_login-logic.md
       AREA_Performance/
         _overview.md
         001_frontend-optimization.md
   ```

When organizing tasks in Claude Code, first create the feature overview, then add individual tasks within that feature.

## CLI and E2E Commands

The `e2e` command is used for running end-to-end tests in the project. It provides a comprehensive testing approach that verifies the entire workflow of the Scopecraft Command system.

### Key Features of the `e2e` Command:
- Runs full end-to-end tests across CLI and MCP interfaces
- Validates task creation, update, and management workflows
- Ensures consistency between different project modes (standalone and Roo Commander)
- Checks integration points between Core, CLI, and MCP modules

### Usage Examples:
```bash
# Run all end-to-end tests
sc e2e

# Run e2e tests for a specific module
sc e2e --module cli
sc e2e --module mcp

# Run tests with verbose output
sc e2e --verbose

# Run tests and generate a detailed report
sc e2e --report
```

### Test Coverage:
- Task CRUD operations
- Phase management
- MDTM directory structure validation
- Interface consistency (CLI vs MCP)
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance and load testing

### Best Practices:
- Run e2e tests before major releases
- Integrate e2e tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Continuously expand test scenarios to cover new features
