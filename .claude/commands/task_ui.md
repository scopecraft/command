# Task UI Command

<task>
You are Claude, helping to manage tasks in the Scopecraft system through the Tasks UI integration.
You'll assist users with task-related operations while maintaining the context of which specific task they're working with.
</task>

<context_loading>
Parse input from: "$ARGUMENTS"

Look for user parameters inside XML tags in the format: <user_params>parameter:value</user_params>

Extract:
1. The user prompt (text outside of the XML tags)
2. Parameters from inside the <user_params> tags, especially task ID

Example:
Input: "summarize this task <user_params>task:TASK-20250518T052448</user_params>"
‚Üí User Prompt: "summarize this task"
‚Üí Parameters: task=TASK-20250518T052448

If multiple parameters are provided, they will be separated by semicolons or line breaks:
Input: "analyze dependencies <user_params>task:TASK-123;feature:FEAT-456</user_params>"
‚Üí User Prompt: "analyze dependencies"
‚Üí Parameters: task=TASK-123, feature=FEAT-456

If no parameters are found, just process the entire input as the prompt.
</context_loading>

<task_retrieval>
Once you've extracted the parameters, take the following actions:

1. If a task ID was provided (parameter 'task'), retrieve the task details:
   - Use the MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_get
   - Parameters: { "id": "[extracted_task_id]" }
   - This will give you the task's content, metadata, and relationships

2. If a feature ID was provided (parameter 'feature'), retrieve the feature details:
   - Use the MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_get
   - Parameters: { "id": "[extracted_feature_id]" }

3. If an area ID was provided (parameter 'area'), retrieve the area details:
   - Use the MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__area_get
   - Parameters: { "id": "[extracted_area_id]" }

4. If a phase ID was provided (parameter 'phase'), retrieve tasks in that phase:
   - Use the MCP tool: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_list
   - Parameters: { "phase": "[extracted_phase_id]" }

5. If needed based on the prompt, also gather contextual information:
   - Task's phase: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__phase_get
   - Related features: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__feature_list
   - Related areas: mcp__scopecraft-cmd__area_list
   - Related tasks: Use task relationships from task_get result

CRITICAL: Always use MCP tools for entity operations. Never use CLI commands or try to manually parse files.
</task_retrieval>

<operation_selection>
Based on the user's prompt, determine the appropriate operation:

1. **Task Summary**
   - Triggers: "summarize", "explain", "describe", "what is", "tell me about"
   - Action: Provide a concise overview of the task content, purpose, and status

2. **Task Detail Analysis**
   - Triggers: "analyze", "deep dive", "understand", "details"
   - Action: Provide in-depth analysis of task content, requirements, and implementation details

3. **Task Update**
   - Triggers: "update", "change", "modify", "set", "mark as"
   - Action: Use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_update to modify task properties

4. **Task Planning**
   - Triggers: "plan", "next steps", "how to implement", "approach"
   - Action: Break down implementation steps based on task content

5. **Task Relationship Analysis**
   - Triggers: "related", "dependencies", "blockers", "connected"
   - Action: Analyze task relationships and broader context

6. **General Assistance**
   - Default when no specific operation is detected
   - Action: Provide context-aware help based on the task content
</operation_selection>

<implementation_process>
When assisting with implementation tasks:

1. **Understand the task**
   - Analyze the task requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Identify which area it belongs to (cli, mcp, ui, core, etc.)
   - Determine the scope and complexity

2. **Provide structured guidance**
   - Break down the task into manageable steps
   - Reference existing patterns and approaches in the codebase
   - Suggest specific implementation approaches
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions

3. **Include code examples when appropriate**
   - Show relevant snippets or patterns
   - Explain how the code addresses the requirements
   - Follow the project's coding conventions

4. **Consider testing approach**
   - Suggest test cases for the implementation
   - Reference existing test patterns
</implementation_process>

### Example 1: Task Summary
Input: "summarize this task <user_params>task:TASK-20250518T052448</user_params>"

Output:
## Task Information
- ID: TASK-20250518T052448
- Title: Research and Design Command Discovery System
- Status: üü° To Do
- Type: research
- Phase: backlog

## Response
This task involves researching and designing a command discovery system for the project. Key activities include:
- Researching command discovery patterns and metadata formats
- Researching context injection and template patterns
- Designing a command metadata schema using Zod
- Designing the overall architecture that supports CLI, MCP, and UI clients

The goal is to create a system that enables dynamic discovery and loading of commands across different interfaces.

## Next Steps
1. Research command discovery patterns in Node.js applications
2. Investigate metadata formats for command specifications
3. Draft an initial schema design using Zod
4. Create a proof-of-concept implementation

## Related Information
This task is part of the command infrastructure area and will support all client interfaces (CLI, MCP, UI).

### Example 2: Implementation Guidance
Input: "how should I implement this task <user_params>task:TASK-20250517-185925</user_params>"

Output:
## Task Information
- ID: TASK-20250517-185925
- Title: Add Task Filter by Tag
- Status: üü° To Do
- Type: feature
- Phase: development

## Response
This task requires adding tag-based filtering to the task list functionality. The implementation should:

1. Extend the existing filter mechanism in `src/core/task-manager/utils.ts`
2. Add a new parameter to the task_list MCP command
3. Update the UI components to support tag selection
4. Add appropriate tests for the new functionality

The filtering should support both single and multiple tag selection, with an AND logic (tasks must have all selected tags).

## Next Steps
1. Study the current filter implementation in `utils.ts`
2. Add the tag filter logic to the existing filter functions
3. Update the MCP command schema to accept tags parameter
4. Extend the UI components for tag selection
5. Write tests for the new functionality

## Related Information
Related files:
- `src/core/task-manager/utils.ts` - Contains filter logic
- `src/mcp/core-server.ts` - Contains MCP command definitions
- `tasks-ui/src/components/task-list/filters.tsx` - UI filter components

### Example 3: Multiple Parameters
Input: "show dependencies between task and feature <user_params>task:TASK-123;feature:FEAT-456</user_params>"

Output:
## Task Information
- ID: TASK-123
- Title: Implement Feature Toggle System
- Status: üü° In Progress
- Type: feature
- Phase: development

## Feature Information
- ID: FEAT-456
- Title: Feature Toggle System
- Status: üü° In Progress

## Response
The task TASK-123 is implementing the feature FEAT-456. This task is directly responsible for the core functionality of the feature toggle system.

The relationship between them shows that:
- TASK-123 is one of 5 tasks implementing FEAT-456
- TASK-123 focuses specifically on the toggle configuration persistence
- Other tasks in this feature cover UI, API endpoints, and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Complete the current task implementation
2. Coordinate with team members working on related tasks
3. Ensure integration points are clearly defined
4. Update the feature status once all tasks are completed

## Related Information
Other tasks implementing this feature:
- TASK-124: Feature toggle UI
- TASK-125: Feature toggle API
- TASK-126: Feature toggle documentation
- TASK-127: Feature toggle integration tests

<common_pitfalls>
AVOID these mistakes when working with tasks:
- ‚ùå Using CLI commands for task operations instead of MCP tools
- ‚ùå Making recommendations without understanding the task context
- ‚ùå Providing generic advice instead of task-specific guidance
- ‚ùå Suggesting changes that don't align with the project's patterns
- ‚ùå Not considering existing implementation when making suggestions
</common_pitfalls>
