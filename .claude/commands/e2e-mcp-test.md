Run the end-to-end tests for the MCP server using the STDIO transport.

Follow the prompt-based test plan in `test/mcp/prompt-based-test-plan.md` and execute each test step with the appropriate MCP tool calls.

1. Total tests executed
2. Pass/fail count
3. Any issues discovered
4. Recommendations for fixes or improvements

If specific tests are requested as arguments, only run those tests: $ARGUMENTS
