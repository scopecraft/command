This feature would be configurable both globally (via scopecraft.json) and per-operation (via CLI flags or MCP parameters), giving users flexibility in how they manage their task version history. The implementation would integrate cleanly with the existing configuration system and maintain backward compatibility by defaulting to manual commits.\n\n### Codebase Notes\n\n- **Task CRUD operations** are centralized in `src/core/task-manager/task-crud.ts` with `createTask()` and `updateTask()` functions that already accept optional `RuntimeConfig` parameters\n- **Configuration system** follows a clear precedence hierarchy: runtime > CLI > environment > session > config file > auto-detect, making it easy to add new configuration options\n- **No existing git integration** in task operations, but git functionality exists in other parts (worktree integration, release scripts)\n- **Boolean flag patterns** are well-established in the codebase (e.g., `include_completed`, `include_content`), providing a template for implementation\n- **Clean separation** between CLI/MCP interfaces and core functionality means we can add git operations to the core and expose them through both interfaces consistently\n\n### Task Created\n\nTask ID: FEAT-AUTOCOMMITFUNCTIONALITY-0527-G2\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. **Implement a Git utility module** - Create a dedicated module in `src/core/git/` to handle git operations (checking git availability, staging files, committing) that can be reused across the codebase beyond just task operations.\n\n2. **Add commit message templates** - Allow users to customize commit message formats through configuration, supporting variables like `{{task-id}}`, `{{operation}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{status-change}}` for more descriptive commits.\n\n3. **Create a batch mode** - For operations that might update multiple tasks (like bulk status updates), implement a batch mode that collects all changes and creates a single commit with a summary of all modifications.\n\n### Questions for Further Exploration\n\n1. **Commit granularity preference** - Would you prefer one commit per task operation, or should the system intelligently batch related operations (e.g., creating a feature and its subtasks) into a single commit?\n\n2. **Dirty working directory handling** - How should the system behave if there are uncommitted changes in the working directory? Should it: (a) refuse to auto-commit, (b) stash changes first, or (c) include existing staged changes in the commit?\n\n3. **Integration with existing git workflows** - Should auto-commits respect `.gitignore` patterns, pre-commit hooks, and other git configurations? Should there be an option to skip hooks for auto-commits?\n\n4. **Error recovery and reporting** - When auto-commit fails (e.g., no git repo, network issues for remote operations), should the task operation still succeed with a warning, or should it rollback the entire operation?\n\n5. **Scope of auto-commit functionality** - Beyond task create/update, should this extend to other operations like task deletion, phase management, or bulk operations? What about automatic pushing to remote repositories?","total_cost":1.7563552499999997,"session_id":"8f4a1c8f-9f39-439b-bc54-8f1fcdb5b8e8"}
